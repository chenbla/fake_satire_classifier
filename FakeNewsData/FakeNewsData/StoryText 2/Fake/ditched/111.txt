MIKE POMPEO IS SETTING THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA, FAKE NEWS STRAIGHT; OBAMA SKIPPED A LOT OF INTEL BRIEFINGS, POMPEO SAYS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS DIFFERENT
In an interview with MSNBC, the new CIA Director Mike Pompeo turned their narrative of President Trump on it’s head, saying that the president is a “serious consumer” of intelligence. What a stark contrast to an NBC article that claimed President Trump was at “war” with the intelligence community.
From IJR:
“CIA Director Mike Pompeo said President Trump is an ‘avid consumer’ of the intelligence he’s provided and that any reports to the contrary are false.
During an interview that aired Saturday on MSNBC, Pompeo said he meets with Trump “nearly every day.”
‘We have 35 or 40 minutes on his schedule,’ Pompeo said to Hugh Hewitt on his new Saturday morning show. That almost always runs long, which is great. Great questions. He is a serious consumer of the product that the intelligence community delivers and I appreciate that, because I think it informs how he thinks about the world.”
The Washington Examiner also reported that Pompeo can’t “imagine” more of a false statement than claiming Trump isn’t interested in intelligence briefings.
Obama missed the briefing the morning after the Benghazi attack, where four people died. You could tell where his priority was, and it wasn’t with those four dead heroes!
President Trump is a workaholic who cares about America. He is very much unlike Obama who hates America and everything it stands for. SHARE if you agree!
