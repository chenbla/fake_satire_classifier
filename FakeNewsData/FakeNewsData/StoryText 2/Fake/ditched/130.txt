Former Vice President Joe Biden, the man who has been caught numerous times molesting children in public, will run for President in 2020.
Biden’s daughter, Ashley, told reporters on Friday that her 74-year-old father is ‘seriously considering’ the 2020 run for president.
CNN reports: Former Vice President Joe Biden’s daughter, Ashley, added more fuel to the 2020 speculation mill this week, saying that she thinks her father is considering a run for president.
Asked in an interview with Women’s Wear Daily if her father will make a bid for the White House, Ashley Biden said, “I hope so.”
However, she cautioned that he has not made up his mind yet and a decision on an actual run could be a ways off.
“Right now, his focus is on the (Biden) Foundation and Cancer Moonshot, as well as getting other Democrats elected. He’s not there.
He’s taking it day by day after the loss of my dear beloved brother (Beau),” she said.
