Well, well, well! Border crossing is down 90% since Trump became president, says ranchers John Ladd and Fred Davis. They also invited Nancy Pelosi to come visit their ranches but she never responded. As a sign of her liberal mental disorder, Pelosi calls Trump wall ‘a sign of weakness.’

American Mirror reported:

Davis disputed Pelosi’s notion that a wall would divide border towns.
“All the communities that I know about, all the cities along the border, already have high fences,” he told co-host Steve Doocy, disputing Pelosi’s argument.
“Where the wall is necessary is in a lot of the outlying areas that still only have a four-wire barbed-wire fence between Mexico and us.”
Davis said the wall, which he said is one tool, is necessary to stop drug cartels and other criminals from entering the U.S.
“You’ve got to put boots on the ground to make it effective, and that’s been part of the problem on what places they have a wall now,” he said.
