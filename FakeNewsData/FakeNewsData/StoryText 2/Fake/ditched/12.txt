NOW THAT OBAMA IS FINALLY OUT OF OFFICE AND LACKS THE POWER TO PERSECUTE HIS DETRACTORS LAW ENFORCEMENT ICONS ARE GOING ON THE OFFENSIVE AGAINST THE FORMER FIRST MOOCH.  YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE THIS .. Sheriff David Clarke is one of the most visible law enforcement officers in the nation, and he’s also on record as not being a big fan of the Obamas. Now that they’re out of the White House, Clarke is taking aim at Michelle Obama on social media, letting her know what he thought of their departure. In a Twitter post on Friday, Clarke referred to a comment by the former first lady from 2008 stating that, “For the first time in my adult life, I am really proud of my country, because it feels like hope is finally making a comeback.” The comment was made after her husband’s nomination. Clarke’s posting had a considerably different take — and liberals hated it. The tweet came with a picture of Clarke posing in an uber-patriotic Donald Trump shirt: “Michelle Obama said she was never proud of her country til they elected her husband POTUS,” Clarke wrote. “I’ve never been prouder since we got rid of him.” One of the things that seems to have stunned liberals and the media the most about the rise of Donald Trump is that Americans are, in fact, proud of their country. They aren’t believers in revisionist history or the idea that America has to be embarrassed about its own past. Most Americans weren’t supporters of the former first lady’s remarks about only being proud of the country when it nominated her husband.
