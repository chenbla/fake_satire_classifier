PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST HAD 199 PEOPLE ARRESTED IN AN UNEXPECTED OVERNIGHT RAID, MAKING AMERICA JUST THAT MUCH SAFER.
The terrorist threats from even our own citizens are real, as we saw just recently in the shooting of a GOP baseball team. Obama was following right behind Europe in opening up our country to be infiltrated by terrorists who hate the values this country stands on. Now that President Trump is here we have more of a chance to undo the damage that Obama has done when he set up the refugee program that was set up to bring 100,000 Muslims into America.

From Freedom Daily:

“US immigration authorities have arrested and moved to deport 199 Iraqi immigrants, mostly from the Detroit area, in the last three weeks after Iraq agreed to accept deportees as part of a deal removing it from President Donald Trump’s travel ban, officials said on Wednesday.”

“In the Detroit area, 114 Iraqi nationals were arrested over the weekend, and 85 throughout the rest of the country over the past several weeks, Gillian Christensen, a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman, said in a statement.”

“The actions came as part of the Trump administration’s push to increase immigration enforcement and make countries, which have resisted in the past, take back nationals ordered deported from the United States.”

Trump can’t win the war against the liberals and other radical groups by himself. The Americans that want a strong,independent country have to join the forces to defend the constitution. This battle is real.

Thank you President Trump, for trying to clean up the mess obama left here. Drain the swamp! I’m praying for you and your family. I believe you can be one of our greatest presidents. Keep America first and stay safe.
