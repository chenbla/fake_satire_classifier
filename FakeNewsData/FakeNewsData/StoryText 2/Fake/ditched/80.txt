Military Thanks Trump for Transgender Ban: ‘Courageous Decision’

CIVILIANS MAY BE OUTRAGED ABOUT THE TRANSGENDER MILITARY SERVICE REVERSAL BUT OUR SOLDIERS HAVE A DIFFERENT OPINION.
President Trump is under fire for reversing Obama’s social military experiment that allowed transgender individuals to enlist openly. What Obama failed to realize is that the purpose of the US military is to be combat ready both physically and mentally. Transgenders are known to weakened by their surgery and hormone therapy as well as mentally unstable from their gender identity disorder. America’s military has come forward with nothing but gratitude for Trumps decision to go against what Obama attempted to make a norm.

Via Breitbart:

Seventeen “flag-rank” officers who wrote to former President Obama expressing their concerns on his decision to allow transgender individuals to serve in the U.S. military have now sent a letter of thanks to President Donald Trump for his decision to reverse the policy.

“We write today to express our gratitude to you for making the extremely courageous decision to reverse President Obama’s transgender social experiment,” the letter, sent last week, said.

“There may be an enormous amount of vitriol directed at you for making this policy correction, but please know that overturning this policy may have done more in the long-term to save the culture and war-fighting capacity of the U.S. military than perhaps any other military policy you will adopt as president,” the letter said.

“It’s just not compatible with the mission of the military,” Paul E. Vallely, one of the 17 military members who signed the letter, told Breitbart News.

Vallely said this kind of “social engineering” conflicts with the military’s need to be “ready to go to battle to protect America.”



MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN DOES NOT INCLUDE WEARING OUR MILITARY DEFENSE BY ALLOWING UNSTABLE INDIVIDUALS TO SERVE. TRANSGENDERS ARE NOT THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO ARE DENIED THE PRIVILEGE TO BE AN AMERICAN SOLDIER YET DEMOCRATS DON’T CARE ABOUT THE REST OF THE RESTRICTIONS DO THEY?
