AN NBC NEWS REPORT WAS BROADCASTED IN A TIME WHEN THEY WERE A LITTLE MORE CREDIBLE THAT HILLARY CLINTON SHUT DOWN AN INVESTIGATION INTO A PEDOPHILE RING IN ORDER TO SAVE THE BUTT’S OF HIGH RANKING OFFICIALS AND AN AMBASSADOR.
NBC actually provided internal state department memos as evidence that Hillary actually covered up a huge, elite pedophile ring. The whole thing was attached to the then, secretary of state Hillary Clinton. She had the investigation shut down in order to keep the scandal from coming out and ruining not only her career but the high ranking officials and ambassador also.
From Patriot Hangout:
“Serious allegations concerning the State Department,” the NBC anchor announced, before launching into the disturbing details that mainstream media would be unable to report on in 2017.
“According to internal State Department memos the agency might have called off or intervened into investigations into possibly illegal, inappropriate behavior within it’s ranks allegedly to protect jobs and avoid scandals.
“This concerns a time when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state.” 
“Allegations of prostitution and pedophilia, and allegations that those crimes were somehow covered up or not looked into. So the State Department this morning is having to respond to those claims, and those investigations involve misconduct by State Department officials, including an Ambassador and security agents attached to then secretary of state, Hillary Clinton.
In stark contrast, we see how President Donald Trump is handling pedophile scandals, he’s ready to solve this “horrific problem”:
Hillary has covered up rape and pedophilia. But “she did it for women and children.” She’s the epitome of Satan. This is why the democrats were scared to confirm sessions as the AG they know this kind of nasty dirty disgraceful stuff will be found. Shame on the government for even allowing this to go on. Glad it will be stopped thank you President Trump.
