" New Document Reveals Lynch Instructed Comey to Cover-up For Hillary http://president45donaldtrump.com/1-9892-2/ VIA| Ah, the infamous tarmac meeting.  You knowthe one in which former Attorney General Loretta Lynch met with Bill Clintonin her airplaneat the Phoenix Airport?  The one after which many people suspected that a deal had gone down to get Hillary off the hook? Wellaccording to a report in the NY Times, FBI Director James Comey may have been in the same corner as those of us who had concerns about Lynchs objectivity and political bias towards Clinton. From NY Times: At the meeting, everyone agreed that Mr. Comey should not reveal details about the Clinton investigation. But Ms. Lynch told him to be even more circumspect: Do not even call it an investigation, she said, according to three people who attended the meeting. Call it a matter."	Fake
" Chris Christie: Womens Viagra Pill Will Only Increase Lesbianism  The New York Times relates that Representative Cathy McMorris Rogers of Washington State, the top-ranking Republican woman in the House, was quoted by The Daily Beast last week as saying that Democrats were fabricating the war on women to distract from real issues. Joan Walsh wrote on AlterNet: Read and decide for yourself if this war on women is imaginary:  Democrats didnt make the GOP presidential field back personhood laws that would criminalize some forms of birth control. They didnt force the newly elected house GOP to make defunding Planned Parenthood their first legislative goal. And they didnt propose the Blunt Amendment that would have allowed employers to withhold health insurance coverage not only for contraception, but for any treatment they disapproved of.  Furthermore, it would seem that Cathy McMorris Rogers isnt the only Republican waging a crusade against her own sex. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, famous for his sharp tongue and conservative political views, seems to have sjoined McMorris Rogers in their partys obvious war on women in America.  Christie recently addressed the rumors that pharmaceutical companies are extensively researching a Viagra pill for women. The New Jersey governor allegedly denied that such a pill would have numerous benefits for women in a televised interview and verbally attacked the host for asking him such offensive and idiotic questions. When asked to comment on the incident by Newslo, Christie said: Oh no, I really feel like women could use a Viagra pill. Like we dont have enough dykes already.  Asked to elaborate on his offensive language, the anything-but-subtle Republican stated that the only thing such a pill would do for the women of the world is get them to change their sexual orientation.  The men of today already have enough trouble satisfying women as it is. Why do you think Viagra was invented in the first place? But no, lets amplify womens sex drive even further, thatll definitely help them feel more satisfied and relaxed. And who are they going to turn to quench that thirst? Other women. Men arent machines, but neither are they. They just havent realized it yet, Christie concluded."	Fake
" Roger Stone Blames Obama For The Possibility Of Trump Having Alzheimers Because His Attacks On The President Caused Severe Stress  The whispers are growing louder that President Donald Trump may be suffering some sort of mental decline and cognitive impairment  and his longtime pal Roger Stone thinks its a conspiracy. MSNBCs Joe Scarborough, who has known the president for years, has been suggesting on air that Trump is suffering from mental decline and possibly even dementia. Stone, who has known the president for decades and claims to remain in close contact, told InfoWars founder Alex Jones the concerns about Trumps mental state were part of a plot to remove him from the White House, reported Mediaite. They are going to claim that Donald Trump has Alzheimersand that is the source of his insanity, Stone told Jones.  Look, Alex  Ive known Donald Trump for many years now and during that time Ive gotten very close with him, Stone said. Just like youre able to tell when your mother or father or some other family member or friend you spend a lot of time with starts to change in any way, Im also able to tell you all of Donalds little habits, mannerisms, quirky gestures he makes when he speaks and even predict what hes going to say and how hes going to behave depending on his mood. As a matter of fact, Id even go so far as to say that the man is more like a brother to me than a friend. And like I said, when youve spent that much time with someone and gotten to know virtually everything about them, its very easy to tell if and when they start behaving oddly. You know what I mean?  Stone continued, Im telling you right here and now  its all one huge conspiracy to get people to believe Donald is unfit for duty and get him out of the White House. Its the only option they have left, since they couldnt beat him the normal way. Donald Trump does not have Alzheimers, dementia or whatever else theyre saying hes suffering from. Jones asked, But look, I hear you, I get what youre saying and Im on your side, but you have to admit  hes not a young man anymore, hes 70 years old and hes continuously been exposed to huge amounts of stress on a daily level for decades. Are you saying thats not even a remote possibility? Stone replied, Well, thats the thing, Alex  Im not a doctor. Ive spoken to him recently and he was his usual self, from what I could gather.  That being said, in my book, hes the same, old Donald whom Ive known for years and years. Of course, as I mentioned  Im not a doctor or a professional, so I dont have any medical argumentation to support my claims. But, I will say this: in the unlikely event Im wrong and he does have a mental impairment, its Barack Obamas fault. I mean, Barack Obama has attacked Donald Trump since the moment he realized that Donald was thinking about running for president  I think even before he initiated his campaign. His attacks on Donald Trump caused immense stress on a daily level because, thats the thing  Obama had no other arguments to dispute Donalds campaign other than to make jokes about how hes a bad employer and how business is all hes ever been good at. Sure, hes not a politician, but hes a self-made man. In my book, thats way better than being a so-called Democrat who cares more about illegal and Muslim immigrants than he does for his own people. So, I would certainly understand if Donald has Alzheimers because of Barack Obama, Stone concluded."	Fake
" Bill OReilly: Companies Under Trump Must Say Merry Christmas Or Will Be Forced To Send Employees To Religious Classes  Of all the voices crusading against the so-called War on Christmas, perhaps no TV personality has lent their star power to the fight against encroaching secular influence that Fox News host Bill OReilly has. On Thursday, the OReilly Factor host called out the companies that kind of marginalized Christmas this year by failing to use the word in their holiday advertisements and promotions, including Best Buy, Barnes & Noble and Victorias Secret. Those companies are not in the Christmas spirit, OReilly complained. And thats bad news for them, because Donald Trump is on the case.  The pundit argued that the companies in question will be forced to send employees to religious classes if they continue to avoid greeting their customers with the words Merry Christmas. Theyve got a lot of nerve, he said. The vast majority of the people that frequent their stores are Christians, traditional Americans and people who respect and honor these sort of traditions. And when you, as a company thats making money directly off of your customers, refuse to adopt the same values and traditions as your market, youre done. I know it sounds cruel, but thats just the name of the game.  And while were on the subject, OReilly continued, thats also one of the things I have a problem with in American society as of late. Were a nation of immigrants, bla bla bla, everybody already knows the whole story. However, the whole point of America is, were supposed to be always accepting new immigrants, which were doing, by the boatloads, but at the same time, were also supposed to be assimilating them into American society. After a period of time, theyre supposed to become Americans, not stay whatever they were before they came here. And that also goes for religion, as well.  The host also added, And before someone calls me up and accuses me of being bigoted, let me just say that I dont think all naturalized Americans should be Christians. Everybody here is completely entitled to their own religious freedom. However, that doesnt change the fact that the majority of the people born in this country are, in fact, Christians. And given that its our country, not that of our immigrant new citizens  we ought to be greeted with Merry Christmas when we walk into the aforementioned stores to spend our hard earned money. And when our immigrant citizens greet us there as part of their jobs, they should remember that they came to work to America, not the other way around.  And if the aforementioned companies dont start instructing their employees to use Merry Christmas as an official greeting soon, they are going to be forced to send their employees off to religious training lessons and classes, where they will be trained in everything Christianity stands for. And thats going to be the hard way to solve this problem, since the easy way is not likely to work  I can see that even now. So, either companies teach their off-the-books immigrant workers to pronounce the words Merry Christmas when they see a white American person walking into their store, or Uncle Sam is going to do it for them. And trust me, guys  youre not going to like what Uncle Sam has planned. I cant tell you all the details, but Im fairly certain itll include the words water and boarding at some point, OReilly concluded."	Fake
" TODAY: Trump Authorizes Congress To Pursue Criminal Charges Against Hillary http://conservativearmy88.com/today-trump-authorizes-congress-pursue-criminal-charges-hillary/ President Trump has approved Congress to seek after criminal allegations against Hillary Clinton, regardless of the possibility that that implies she winds up in jail. Director of the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Jason Chaffetz, told individuals from the advisory group that a current meeting amongst him and the President uncovered a yearning by Trump to guarantee Hillary Clinton gets whatever equity she merits. Chaffetz told individuals: President Trump went to Philadelphia when we were at our arranging and procedure session. I ran backstage with the President this is what he stated: You make an incredible showing with regards to. Tune in, I comprehend Im the president and you have an occupation. You do the oversight. Try not to back off. Follow all that you need to follow. You take a gander at all that you need to take a gander at. In the event that you sat there and heard what he said to me in regards to seeking after oversight and government, you would be propelled. Furthermore, for him to pass on a message of dont back off, I believe was a decent message. The news that the President bolsters the criminal examination comes days after the Oversight Committee requested FBI Director, James Comey, to hand over the substance of Hillary Clintons email server. Trumps words will probably support their resolve in uncovering any criminal wrong doing by the previous Secretary of State in their proceeded with examination concerning Hillary Clintons utilization of a private email server. This was never a political focusing in the first place and in light of the fact that there was a political race doesnt mean it leaves, Jason Chaffetz told journalists before in the month. There were a considerable measure of different characters that were included in this that we need to take a gander at."	Fake
" NPR: 25 Million Votes For Clinton Completely Fake  She Lost Popular Vote http://conservativearmy88.com/npr-25-million-votes-clinton-completely-fake-lost-popular-vote-2/ A study published by NPR reveals that over 25 million Hillary Clinton votes were completely fraudulent, meaning that the Democratic candidate actually lost the popular vote by a huge margin. A study by the Pew Center claiming that over 800,000 non-citizens voted for Hillary Clinton failed to take into account dead and fraudulent voters which totalled over 25 million registered voters. According to reports, illegal aliens combined with dead voters and multiple state voters explains why Hillary appeared to have won the popular vote over Trump during this years presidential race. A report by the Pew Center on the States finds that more than 1.8 million dead people are currently registered to vote, and 24 million registrations are either invalid or inaccurate, NPR reported in 2012, which is ironic given how NPR is heavily controlled by Democrats. And many of the dead, registered voters somehow keep voting Democrat from beyond the grave, most recently in Philadelphia, Penn. and Colorado. Its also worth noting that the U.S. population has increased since 2012, meaning that theres likely more dead and invalid voters than before. The Pew study found that almost 3 million people are registered to vote in more than one state, NPR added. Thats because when a new resident registers to vote in a state, officials usually never bother to tell his former state about the change in voter residency. Under the catch and release immigration program by the Obama administration, illegal aliens were routinely given bus tickets to travel to other states by immigration officials, so it was theoretically possible for non-citizens to register to vote in a border country illegally, then register to vote in another state after their taxpayer-funded bus dropped them off. Clinton won most of the 163 most populous counties in the US that account for half of the total votes in the election, including dense urban areas in New York and California, yet she only won the popular vote by 2.8 million votes, which reveals the lack of enthusiasm voters had for her in comparison to Trump  and that Democrats would have depended more on illegal votes. A portion of the 24 million invalid voter registrations combined with a portion of the 1.8 million dead voters and the over 800,000 known illegal voters could explain the difference of 2.8 million votes, and its worth noting that the 800,000 figure could be a low, conservative estimate. That said, a popular vote victory is meaningless; if the president was elected by popular vote, then both Trump and Clinton would have campaigned in entirely different states because only densely population regions of the U.S. would decide who would become president. Without the electoral college, the United States of America would be reduced to the United States of New York and California, with 48 other vassal states. Yet notice how Clinton campaigned in other, less populated states. They knew the popular vote was meaningless ahead of the election. However, the popular vote is useful as a barometer for voter fraud since the most populous countries are also the most susceptible to election tampering by illegal, invalid and dead voters. "	Fake
" CONFIRMED: Mueller Team Can Be Disbarred For Clinton Conflicts In Trump Case http://conservativearmy88.com/cconfirmed-mueller-team-can-disbarred-clinton-conflicts-trump-case/ A top national attorney in consultation with U.S. attorneys confirmed to Big League Politics that special counsel Robert Mueller and members of his team can be formally disbarred for waging the Russia case against President Donald Trump. Mueller and his associates have glaring conflicts of interest in the case concerning Trump. Muellers team is tainted not only by partisan political donations and activities, but by direct relationships with former clients like Hillary Clinton, who is integrally involved in most of the possible evidence in this case. These conflicts clearly violate American Bar Association guidelines. Hillary Clinton colluded with the Russians in selling them our uranium. Clinton handpicked Mueller to give a sample of uranium to the Russians, and Mueller subsequently flew to Moscow, according to publicly available documents. Don Trump Jr.s meeting at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer, a showbiz manager and others  in which the adoption-related Magnitsky Act was discussed  is the only thing resembling evidence that the mainstream media has been able to find. But that meeting is tarred with Clinton connections. According to Wikileaks, a Hillary Clinton campaign spokesman said that With the help of the research team we killed a Bloomberg story trying to link HRCs opposition to the Magnitsky bill to a $500,000 speech that [Bill Clinton] gave in Moscow. Radio host Andrew Wilkow said that Clinton took $500,000 from Sberbank, a Russian bank represented by the Podesta Group that also happens to be a client of Natalia Veselnitskayas law firm (Veselnitskaya is the Russian lawyer who met with Don Jr.). Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and the DNC accuse the Russians of hacking their emails, despite evidence to the contrary, which provides further Clinton involvement in the case and further conflicts for Muellers Clinton-linked team. Muellers 13-member Dream Team is comprised of anti-Trump stalwarts including three Democratic Party donors, legal representatives for Hillary Clinton during her email scandal, and vociferous anti-Trump tweeter Preet Bharara, who was fired by Trump from his position as a U.S. Attorney within the Department of Justice. These conflicts of interests, especially pertaining to Clinton, make it necessary for some members of the team to recuse themselves. If they dont, they can be disbarred. The American Bar Associations Criminal Justice Standards for the Prosecution Function make clear that Muellers team is in violation of standards, according to the top national attorney. Here are the relevant sections (emphasis added): A prosecutor should not use other improper considerations, such as partisan or political or personal considerations, in exercising prosecutorial discretion. A prosecutor should strive to eliminate implicit biases, and act to mitigate any improper bias or prejudice when credibly informed that it exists within the scope of the prosecutors authority. (b)  A prosecutors office should be proactive in efforts to detect, investigate, and eliminate improper biases, with particular attention to historically persistent biases like race, in all of its work.  A prosecutors office should regularly assess the potential for biased or unfairly disparate impacts of its policies on communities within the prosecutors jurisdiction, and eliminate those impacts that cannot be properly justified.  Standard 3-1.7           Conflicts of Interest (a)  The prosecutor should know and abide by the ethical rules regarding conflicts of interest that apply in the jurisdiction, and be sensitive to facts that may raise conflict issues.  When a conflict requiring recusal exists and is non-waivable, or informed consent has not been obtained, the prosecutor should recuse from further participation in the matter. The office should not go forward until a non-conflicted prosecutor, or an adequate waiver, is in place (c)  The prosecutor should not participate in a matter in which the prosecutor previously participated, personally and substantially, as a non-prosecutor, unless the appropriate government office, and when necessary a former client, gives informed consent confirmed in writing. (d)  The prosecutor should not be involved in the prosecution of a former client. A prosecutor who has formerly represented a client should not use information obtained from that representation to the disadvantage of the former client. (f)  The prosecutor should not permit the prosecutors professional judgment or obligations to be affected by the prosecutors personal, political, financial, professional, business, property, or other interests or relationships.  A prosecutor should not allow interests in personal advancement or aggrandizement to affect judgments regarding what is in the best interests of justice in any case. g)  The prosecutor should disclose to appropriate supervisory personnel any facts or interests that could reasonably be viewed as raising a potential conflict of interest.  If it is determined that the prosecutor should nevertheless continue to act in the matter, the prosecutor and supervisors should consider whether any disclosure to a court or defense counsel should be made, and make such disclosure if appropriate. (j)  The prosecutor should promptly report to a supervisor all but the most obviously frivolous misconduct allegations made, publicly or privately, against the prosecutor.  If a supervisor or judge initially determines that an allegation is serious enough to warrant official investigation, reasonable measures, including possible recusal, should be instituted to ensure that the prosecution function is fairly and effectively carried out.  A mere allegation of misconduct is not a sufficient basis for prosecutorial recusal, and should not deter a prosecutor from attending to the prosecutors duties. The conflicts of interest are everywhere. Peter Strzok, who oversaw the Hillary Clinton email investigation for the FBI and interviewed Hillary Clinton, is on Muellers team. Clinton donor Jeannie Rhee, who represented the Clinton Foundation and also Hillary Clinton during the email investigation, is on Muellers team. Aaron Zebley, who repped Clinton aide and key email-scandal figure Justin Cooper, is on Muellers team. Andrew Weissmann defended the federal governments surveillance rightsin a panel discussion at the George Soros-funded New America Foundation, is also an Obama donor. Preet Bharara, the man who prosecuted conservative writer Dinesh DSouza and was a leading contender to be Hillary Clintons theoretical Attorney General, was fired by the Trump administration, presenting another conflict of interest that he seems to have no intention of hiding. How about Mueller himself? CIA and NSA whistleblower Dennis Montgomery identified former FBI director Mueller as having overseen a secret surveillance program that spied on Trumps phone calls for years. The alleged program, created during the Bush administration and run by Obama intelligence officials John Brennan and James Clapper, is detailed on 47 hard drives that Montgomery and his lawyer turned over to the FBI, which James Comey buried. Montgomery is suing Obama, Brennan, Clapper and others in a case before D.C. District Court Judge Richard Leon. This case is being watched closely by insiders on both sides of the Russia probe. Mueller also helped stonewall the Obama administrations investigation of its own IRS targeting scandal. As Big League Politics reported, Mueller has formed a political team with his friend, fired FBI director James Comey, and the current FBI director Andrew McCabe to work together against President Donald Trump. But Mueller and Comey are not the ringleaders. Surprisingly, its McCabe. An inside source told Big League Politics that McCabe is running the show, and hes the key. Mueller and McCabe are assembling a better political operation than Hillary had in the campaign. The trio of Mueller/McCabe and Comey are all creatures of the swamp, the source explained. Any Republican who thinks this isnt a political operation and isnt geared toward impacting 2018 and beyond is absolutely nuts. I think McCabe is the most politically savvy given how he navigated the controversy with his wifes campaign donations and the Clinton investigation, the source continued. McCabe took over when Comey got fired and quickly set up the teams power play. McCabe said that Comey did not get fired from the FBI for performance issues. That sets up the premise for a potential obstruction of justice move by the McCabe-Mueller-Comey trio."	Fake
" BECAUSE TRUMP WON THE PRESIDENCY, FORD Shifts TRUCK PRODUCTION FROM MEXICO TO OHIO! http://conservativearmy88.com/trump-won-presidency-ford-shifts-truck-production-mexico-ohio/ Fords heavy duty pickup trucks which used to be built in Mexico started rolling off an assembly line in Ohio this week. Thats good news for the 1,000 Ford workers in Ohio, who might have otherwise been out of work. Its also good publicity for Ford (F), which has been under fire for investing so much in Mexico. In April, the automaker said it would invest $2.5 billion in transmission plants in the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Guanajuato, creating about 3,800 jobs there. Fords south-of-the-border strategy has drawn heavy criticism from groups such as the United Auto Workers union and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. The Avon Lake, Ohio, plant produced its first batch of Fords full-size F-650 and F-750 pick up trucks on Wednesday. Our investmentreinforces our commitment to building vehicles in America, said Joe Hinrichs, Ford president, The Americas. Working with our partners in the UAW, we found a way to make the costs competitive enough to bring production of a whole new generation of work trucks to Ohio. The move comes at a delicate time for Ford. The United Auto Workers union is in negotiations with the automaker as well as General Motors (GM) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAM) on new labor deals to replace those that expire next month. And promises by the automakers to keep production and jobs at U.S. plants is a major focus of the union. The union is particularly worried about the plan Ford announced in July to shift production of the C-Max and Focus out of a Wayne, Mich., plant in 2018. The automaker hasnt said where that work will go, but employees fear those cars will be built in Mexico. Its also not clear whether any other cars will be made at the Wayne plant instead, in order to protect about 4,000 jobs. Were actively pursuing other alternatives for the Wayne plant that will be discussed with our UAW friends. We havent decided what will go there, said Ford spokeswoman Kristina Adamski. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump recently said that if hes elected he would take steps to make it more expensive for manufacturers to shift work to Mexico and then export the items back to the United States. How does that help us? Trump said about the Ford investment in Mexico while campaigning in Michigan this week. Mexico is becoming the new China. Source:www.viralliberty.com"	Fake

" TRUMP Makes HUGE ANNOUNCEMENT About SOUTHERN WALL  THIS THING IS GOING TO BE A BEAST! http://president45donaldtrump.com/trump-makes-huge-announcement-southern-wall-thing-going-beast/ ELDER PATRIOT  It seems like everyday President Trump makes good on at least one of his campaign promises.  At this rate hell have to make some new promises after six months. Customs and Border Protection is the Homeland Security Department agency that will oversee the construction of the wall along our southern border that will be designed to keep illegal drugs and aliens from entering our country.  CBP has released a request for bids based on two different designs. Both plans require the wall to be sunk at least six feet into the ground and to include 25- and 50-foot automated gates for pedestrians and vehicles. The proposed wall must also be built in a such a way that it would take at least an hour to cut through it with a sledgehammer, car jack, pick axe, chisel, battery operated impact tools, battery operated cutting tools, Oxy/acetylene torch or other similar hand-held tools. Additionally, the wall must be at least 30-foot-high, look attractive from the north side, and be difficult to climb over. President Trump has capped the cost of covering all of the approximately 2,000 miles at $12 billion.  His political opponents claim that the cost will be quite a bit higher.  That figures since they regularly overpay for everything because they have no respect for taxpayer money. If theres one thing President Trump knows as well as anyone in the world it is building costs.  Ill trust his numbers. The fact is the wall will save American taxpayers many multiples of the cost to build it every year that it is in place.  That doesnt take into account the savings in human carnage caused by gangs and drugs. As an added bonus to American workers the materials must be sourced from within the United States! Im still trying to remember one promise that Barack Obama kept in his eight years.  He didnt promise to wreck the country did he?"	Fake
" Trump Sends Feds In To Raid NYs Islamberg After 2 DECADES  Uncover Americas WORST Nightmare http://www.redrocktribune.com/feds-raid-nys-islamberg/ NEW YORKS ISLAMBERG HAS BEEN ON THE RADAR FOR TERRORISTIC ACTIVITY FOR DECADES BUT LAW OFFICIALS NEVER HAD A REASON FOR A SEARCH WARRANT. FINALLY, law enforcement was able to obtain a search warrant for the Islamberg compound. Though the Muslim compound has been suspected for terrorism because of their guarded entrance and the sound of explosions and gunfire for the last couple of decades law enforcement never found a reason to obtain a search warrant until now. From Freedom Daily: But with a recent arrest of Islamberg resident Ramadan Abdullah who was recently caught trying to steal several cases of ammunition from a local mountain store in the area, authorities finally had their chance to obtain a search warrant for the compound, and what they discovered was nothing short of chilling. Shortly after arresting Ramadan Abdullah for theft, the Muslims answers about why he was stealing ammunition raised suspicion among police, who then decided to obtain a search warrant to investigate their suspicions further. During their raid they discovered a massive stockpile of illegal weapons throughout the Islamberg location, including 8 assault weapons, 4 loaded handguns, 1 loaded shotgun, 2 rifles, 64 high-capacity ammunition feeding devices, and body armor, including thousands of rounds of .50 caliber ammunition capable of piercing body armor. But illegal cache of weapons seized at the compound was unfortunately just the beginning. After Abdullahs arrest, authorities began looking closer into his background, discovering that the Muslim is a long-time associate of the U.S.-based Islamist terrorist organization, Muslims of America (MOA), and was the very same Muslim who was arrested back in 1977 after police discovered enough material at his home to build 50 bombs. here are ISIS training camps across the United States that were protected by the Clintons, Obama, and the Democratic Party. Every compound needs to be raided with every person living at these camps investigated and charged with terrorism. Its not hard to do just activate the national guard so they can get some of the training they need. Muslims have training camps that we wont raid, but the Feds had no problem raiding the compound in Waco, Texas years ago that wound up killing everyone inside including a lot of children under then attorney general Janet Reno now didnt they? But its xenophobic to raid a Muslim compound, right?"	Fake

We have 35 or 40 minutes on his schedule, Pompeo said to Hugh Hewitt on his new Saturday morning show. That almost always runs long, which is great. Great questions. He is a serious consumer of the product that the intelligence community delivers and I appreciate that, because I think it informs how he thinks about the world. The Washington Examiner also reported that Pompeo cant imagine more of a false statement than claiming Trump isnt interested in intelligence briefings. Obama missed the briefing the morning after the Benghazi attack, where four people died. You could tell where his priority was, and it wasnt with those four dead heroes!

NBC actually provided internal state department memos as evidence that Hillary actually covered up a huge, elite pedophile ring. The whole thing was attached to the then, secretary of state Hillary Clinton. She had the investigation shut down in order to keep the scandal from coming out and ruining not only her career but the high ranking officials and ambassador also. From Patriot Hangout: Serious allegations concerning the State Department, the NBC anchor announced, before launching into the disturbing details that mainstream media would be unable to report on in 2017. According to internal State Department memos the agency might have called off or intervened into investigations into possibly illegal, inappropriate behavior within its ranks allegedly to protect jobs and avoid scandals. This concerns a time when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state.  Allegations of prostitution and pedophilia, and allegations that those crimes were somehow covered up or not looked into. So the State Department this morning is having to respond to those claims, and those investigations involve misconduct by State Department officials, including an Ambassador and security agents attached to then secretary of state, Hillary Clinton. In stark contrast, we see how President Donald Trump is handling pedophile scandals, hes ready to solve this horrific problem: Hillary has covered up rape and pedophilia. But she did it for women and children. Shes the epitome of Satan. This is why the democrats were scared to confirm sessions as the AG they know this kind of nasty dirty disgraceful stuff will be found. Shame on the government for even allowing this to go on.

Former spokes person for Obama, Kevin Lewis, released this statement after President Trump tweeted that Obama tapped his phones prior to the election: Of course they would try and cover it up instead of admitting the truth. Everything that Obama and his minions have done thus far has been to smear the name of Donald Trump. From Trump Gone Viral: Interestingly, however, a number of other former Obama administration officials do not deny that such a wiretap existed. They just deny that the White House or Obama himself would have approved it or ordered it, and say that the Department of Justice would have sought it in consultation with a foreign intelligence surveillance, or FISA, court. Obamas former speechwriter Jon Favreau tweeted that he would warn reporters against saying there was no wiretap. And Favreau endorsed a Twitter feed that laid out the reporting about the existence of the wiretaps, which cited reporting from Louise Mensch, formerly of Heat Street, and The Guardian that the Obama DOJ had sought a FISA court approved surveillance warrant for Trump Tower back in the summer of 2016 that was denied but received a narrower focused warrant in October. David Axelrod, another former Obama adviser, tweeted that such a wiretap would receive court approval for a reason. They are very obviously not denying that there was a wiretap on President Trump. In fact, their trying to subtly say that they had good reason to tap Trump. Because hes so corrupt, right? I can already see how theyre going to flip this one on our President.

Youd think that America would learn to go against the lane that Europe is in to avoid being overrun by terrorists. But denial is a crazy thing Weve got high up government officials who are on board with bringing Sharia law and destroying America and we have dim witted citizens who believe everything the mainstream media has to say. Minnesota just made a move that will help the agenda of radical Muslims everywhere From Freedom daily: Anti-blasphemy laws have been a massive victory for Muslims across the world, as now followers of Islam can have people who speak out or criticize their religion thrown into prison. In an unprecedented and unconstitutional move, liberal politicians Minneapolis, Minnesota, have just set up a hotline where Muslims can call in and report any American who harasses or speaks out against their religion. While this sounds like something youd read off of a conspiracy website, its really happening. According to Minneapolis local newspaper, the Star-Tribune, the hotline was set up as a way to target Trump supporters, who Muslims believe are the group of people most likely to harass them. The Star Tribune reported: The city of Minneapolis has set up a hot line for residents to report hate-crime incidents and other acts of intolerance. The service, operated through the citys 311 help line, is aimed to aid targets of any harassing behaviors motivated by prejudice, according to a city news release issued on Monday. These lawmakers and judges need to be jailed for treason and that wont happen until true Americans rise up and put them in there place! The fight is coming and soon. Whether we stand up as a country, supporting the Constitution and our way of life or not, is to be decided. Make no mistake, it is Islams goal to control this great land. When are they going to start arresting people who speak against christians and curse God and Jesus? Allow Islam in our schools but not Jesus? This is why America isnt the great land that it once was, this country was founded on christian faith and beliefs."	Fake
" Proof that Mass Voter Fraud Swung New Hampshire Election ~ http://www.ini-world-report.org/2017/09/08/proof-that-mass-voter-fraud-swung-new-hampshire-election/ Republicans have been warning about the dangers of voter fraud for years, and for most of that time Democrats have been pretending that the problem just doesnt exist. Democrats argue that the GOP fixation on voter fraud is all about denying some citizens the right to vote, meanwhile Republicans argue that the Democrats near-monolithic defense of voter fraud is all about winning extra votes. Both arguments have merit, but the Democrats are lying when they pretend that the problem simply doesnt exist. Every election there are countless examples of voter fraud (sometimes even mass voter fraud) that come to light, and this election has been no different. However, the latest shoe to drop on the voter fraud front could be a game changer if the national media will pay any attention to the story. In New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton won the vote by the slimmest of margins. Less than 3K votes separated the two candidates. The race for Senator was even closer, and some local elections were decided by just a handful of votes. These facts make what the state government just discovered all the more troubling. State law requires that anyone moving to the state must acquire a new drivers license within 60 days of establishing residency, but more than 5K 2016 voters have still not done that, leading authorities to believe that these were fraudulent voters who came to the state to influence the outcome of the election. On Nov. 8, 2016, 6,540 voters used an out-of-state drivers license as identification to vote but as of Aug. 30, 2017, only 1,014 of those individuals  15.5 percent  had been issued a New Hampshire drivers license, according to the data. Of the remaining 5,526 individuals, only 3.3 percent  about 213 people  had a registered motor vehicle. That would leave 5,313 people who used an out-of-state license to vote but never obtained a new New Hampshire license despite being required to by state law after implying that they were establishing residency or domicile in the state to vote in November. Of the 5,313 individuals who registered to vote same-day on Election Day, 81 percent  4,314 people  neither held a New Hampshire drivers license nor had a registered vehicle in the state ever. With the exception of the gubernatorial race  where Republican Chris Sununu easily bested Democrat Colin Van Ostern by more than 16,000 votes  Democrats won all the other statewide and Congressional races. But three races were determined by less than 5,000 votes: Gov. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat, beat incumbent U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte by 1,017 votes  although many have suspected that last minute, illegal campaign mailers pushing votes to independent Aaron Day cost Ayotte the race. Hillary Clinton bested Donald Trump by 2,736, earning the states 4 Electoral College votes even though she ultimately lost the presidency. U.S. Rep. Carol Shea-Porter was sent back to Congress after she bested incumbent U.S. Rep. Frank Guinta by a few more than 4,900 votes. In the grand scheme of things 5K fraudulent votes in a nation of 315 million people may not seem like much, but in a state where 3 of the most important races were decided by less than 5K votes, its monumental. Consider the failed Obamacare repeal vote; could Senator Kelly Ayotte have helped the GOP ram repeal through? Or how much help could Rep. Frank Guinta be giving the House GOP if hed actually defeated his liberal opponent? The state government must continue its investigation and these fraudulent voters must be brought to justice. Voter fraud is a felony and it should be investigated and prosecuted as such."	Fake
" Audio: Seymour Hersh States Seth Rich Was WikiLeaks Source http://www.ini-world-report.org/2017/08/03/more-on-seth-rich-murder/ In an audio recording provided to Big League Politics by a source that currently wishes to remain anonymous, journalist Seymour Hersh confirms that Seth Rich had contacted WikiLeaks with sample emails from the leak. Hersh cites an FBI document as proof for his claim. There are no DNC or Podesta emails that exist beyond May 21 or 22, last email from either one of those groups. What the report says is that some time in late Spring he makes contact with WikiLeaks, thats in his computer, he says. Anyway, they found what he had done is that he had submitted a series of documents  of emails, of juicy emails, from the DNC. Hersh explains that it was unclear how the negotiations went, but that WikiLeaks did obtain access to a password protected DropBox where Rich had put the files. All I know is that he offered a sample, an extensive sample, Im sure dozens of emails, and said I want money. Later, WikiLeaks did get the password, he had a DropBox, a protected DropBox, he said. They got access to the DropBox. Hersh also states that Rich had concerns about something happening to him, and had The word was passed, according to the NSA report, he also shared this DropBox with a couple of friends, so that if anything happens to me its not going to solve your problems, he added. WikiLeaks got access before he was killed. This conversation is the second in a series provided to Big League Politics. Seymour Hersh did not contact the family with his information. In the first audio recording, private investigator Rod Wheeler explains what happened with the Fox News coverage of Seth Rich  and how brother Aaron Rich was actively attempting to shut down anyone looking into the WikiLeaks connection. His story in the audio contradicts reports of White House involvement with the media reports regarding Seth Rich. Wheeler also said that brother Aaron Rich tried to block Wheeler from looking at Seths computer, even though there could be evidence on it. He said no, he said I have his computer, meaning him, Wheeler said. I said, well can I look at it?He said, what are you looking for? I said anything that could indicate if Seth was having problems with someone. He said no, I already checked it. Dont worry about it."	Fake
" THE UNANSWERED MYSTERY OF THE CENTURY!!! A GREAT SIGNIFICANT SERIOUS MYSTERY ~    A MUST READ !!! http://www.ini-world-report.org/2016/12/21/the-unanswered-mystery-of-the-century/ (and the answer to the final question below is: No! just dumbed-down!!!) When Obama is out of office it will be interesting to see what they put in his Library regarding his early years.   In a country where we take notice of many facets of our public figures lives, doesnt it seem odd that theres so little we know about our current man in the White House, Barack Obama? For example, we know that Andrew Jacksons wife smoked a corn cob pipe and was accused of adultery.  Abe Lincoln never went to school.  Jack Kennedy wore a back brace.  Harry Truman played the piano. As Americans, we enjoy knowing details about our newsmakers, but none of us know one single amazing fact about the history of our two term president  Barack Hussein Obama. We are all aware of the lack of uncontestable birth records for Obama, because the management of that document has been spectacularly successful. There are however, several additional oddities in Obamas history that appear to be as well managed as the birthing issue. Another interesting thing:  There are no birth certificates of his daughters that can be found? Its interesting that no one who ever dated him has shown up.  The charisma that caused women to be drawn to him so strongly during his campaign would, in the normal course of events, lead some lady to come forward, if only to garner some attention for herself.  We all know about JFKs magnetism; that McCain was no monk; quite a few details about Palins courtship and even her athletic prowess; Joe Bidens aneurisms are no secret;  look at Cheney and Clinton  we all  know about their heart  problems. Certainly Wild Bill Clintons exploits before and during his White House years, were well known.  Thats why its so odd that not one lady has stepped up and said, He was soooo shy or What a great dancer Its virtually impossible to know anything about this fellow.   Who was the best man at his wedding?   Start there. Then check groomsmen. Then get the footage of his graduation ceremony.   Has anyone talked to the professors?  It is odd that no one is bragging that they knew him or taught him or lived with him. When did he meet Michele, and how?   Are there photos there?  Every president gives to the public all their photos, etc. for their library, etc.    What has he released?    And who voted for him to be the most popular man in 2010?    Doesnt this make you wonder? Ever wonder why no one ever came forward from Obamas past saying they knew him, attended school with him, or was his friend ?   Not one person has ever come forward from his past, and that certainly is very, very strange. This should be a cause for great concern.   To those who voted for him, you may have elected an unqualified, inexperienced shadow man.   Have you seen a movie named The Manchurian Candidate ?   It is a classic, and it is pertinent. As insignificant as each of us might be, someone with whom we went to school will remember our name or face.  Someone will remember we were the clown or the dork or the brain or the quiet one or the bully or something about  us. George Stephanopoulos of ABC News said the same thing during the 2008 campaign.    He questions why no one has acknowledged the president was in their classroom or ate in the same cafeteria or made impromptu speeches on campus.  Stephanopoulos also was a classmate of Obama at Columbia  the class of 1984.  He says he never had a single class with  him. If he is such a great orator; why doesnt anyone in Obamas college class remember him?  Why wont he allow Columbia to release his records?  The fact is that  Nobody remembers Obama at Columbia University. Looking for evidence of Obamas past,    Fox News contacted 400 Columbia University students from the period when Obama claims to have been there but none remembered him. Wayne Allyn Root was, like Obama, a political science major at Columbia who also graduated in 1983.    In 2008, Root says of Obama, I dont know a single person at Columbia that knew him, and they all know me. I dont have a classmate who ever knew Barack Obama at Columbia, ever. Nobody recalls him. Root adds that he was also, like Obama, Class of 83 Political Science, and says, You dont get more exact or closer than that. Never met him in my life, dont know anyone who ever met him.    At class reunion, our 20th reunion five years ago, who was asked to be the speaker of the class?   Me.  No one ever heard of Barack!   And five years ago, nobody even knew who he was. The guy who writes the class notes, whos kind of the, as we say in New York, the macha who knows everybody, has yet  to find a person, a human who ever met  him. And Obama consistently declines requests to talk about his years at Columbia, or to provide school records, or provide the name of any former classmates or friends while at Columbia. Some other interesting questions:   Why was Obamas law license inactivated in 2002?   It is said there is no record of him ever taking the Bar exam.  and  Why was Michelles law license inactivated by court order?   We understand that was forced or required to avoid fraud charges. It is circulating that according to the U.S. Census, there is only one Barack Obama, but there are 27 Social Security numbers and over 80 alias connected to him. The Social Security number Obama now uses originated in Connecticut, where Obama is reported to have never lived.   The number was originally registered to another man (Thomas Louis Wood) from Connecticut, who died in Hawaii while on vacation there.   As we all know, Social Security Numbers are only issued once, and they are not reused.   No wonder all his records are sealed !!! Please continue sending this out.  Somewhere, Someone has to know SOMETHING!?!    School? Before he became an organizer in Chicago?  SOMETHING!!!   He just seemed to burst upon the Scene at the 2004 Democratic Convention.  ANYONE??? ANYWHERE??? ANYTHING??? Surely in the near future, when he no longer has the power of the presidency, much will come to light about this highly unqualified person who has been president of the United States for 8 years.  Soon, we will know how badly we were all doped and duped by this imposter who has, with much help from those who created him, nearly brought the greatest nation in history to its knees in ruins.  And that will be his legacy  the man who destroyed the Integrity, Morals and Christian Heritage of our once great country. Who in the hell is this man?  Is America stupid or what? You must forward this email to all of your contacts.  It is vital to the integrity of the United States of America to really know who has been in the White House the past eight years, understand how he was manufactured, and know the details of this essentially successful anti-American, anti-culture, anti-Christian conspiracy."

" SAVE THIS FOR NEXT TUESDAY NIGHT, NOVEMBER 8TH ~ http://www.ini-world-report.org/2016/11/02/save-this-for-next-tuesday-night-november-8th/ BUSTED, HERE ARE THE COMPLETE ELECTION RESULTS THIS IS CONFIRMED ACCURATE, AND IS RIPPED STRAIGHT OFF THE WORLDNOW MEDIA SERVER FOX, CBS, AND OTHERS USE. THIS IS NOT A SPOOF, THEY ALREADY FINALIZED THE ELECTION. Worldnow is a central company that helps all the news stations stay synchronized so they all report the same news. This is a bust of that company, that already has the election results ready for the stations to post, complete with their station graphics. On election day, they go live with this. This is completely confirmed in the second report on this page, covering this topic. Get the WRCBtv (Chattanooga) page that has already been prepared for election night directly from worldnow while it lasts and here is the direct link to WRCBtv that proves they dont have it posted yet. IMPORTANT  look at the lower left hand corner of your browser when you access WRCBtv. You will see all content is coming from Worldnow.com, which proves that the page capture in the picture below is a hidden page that will be used. You cant get to it from ANYWHERE on the WRCBtv web site, it is waiting to be posted. HERE IS THE STOLEN ELECTION, IN DETAIL. This was pre-prepared for a tv station in Memphis. You can see that this is set up to hit the end percentages with an algorithm to steal it changing the numbers as the vote progresses to hit those percentages by cross checking this first list here, which has already been prepared for WMCTV in Memphis, with the second list that is embedded in the report below this, that was prepared for a news aggregating web site that happened to use Worldnow, where I prove this is legit. Comparing the two lists mathematically proves yet another way that an algorithm with dynamic fractional vote tabulation that is tasked to hit end result percentages is being used to steal the election. Here are the easy to read totals THAT ARE ALREADY TABULATED FOR WMCTV in Memphis. There is not just one news station showing this. It is a complete bust of the entire system.

YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE THIS .. Sheriff David Clarke is one of the most visible law enforcement officers in the nation, and hes also on record as not being a big fan of the Obamas. Now that theyre out of the White House, Clarke is taking aim at Michelle Obama on social media, letting her know what he thought of their departure. In a Twitter post on Friday, Clarke referred to a comment by the former first lady from 2008 stating that, For the first time in my adult life, I am really proud of my country, because it feels like hope is finally making a comeback. The comment was made after her husbands nomination. Clarkes posting had a considerably different take  and liberals hated it. The tweet came with a picture of Clarke posing in an uber-patriotic Donald Trump shirt: Michelle Obama said she was never proud of her country til they elected her husband POTUS, Clarke wrote. Ive never been prouder since we got rid of him. One of the things that seems to have stunned liberals and the media the most about the rise of Donald Trump is that Americans are, in fact, proud of their country. They arent believers in revisionist history or the idea that America has to be embarrassed about its own past. Most Americans werent supporters of the former first ladys remarks about only being proud of the country when it nominated her husband. "	Fake
" Obama Signs Executive Order: Appoints Rashad Hussain As New Supreme Court Justice http://newsexaminer.net/politics/obama-signs-executive-order-appoints-rashad-hussain-new-supreme-court-justice/ WASHINGTON  Just two days after the funeral for the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last Sunday of a heart attack at the age of 79, President Obama signed Executive Order 14651, which appoints Rashad Hussain as the new Supreme Court Justice to replace Scalia. We cannot wait for a new President or the Senate Republicans to fill this vacancy left by Scalia, so I have taken it upon myself to do what needed to be done, Obama told reporters at a press conference today. Republican Senators believe that it is appropriate not to act on such an important matter, and as I have shown today, I do not agree with that. Hussain, of Muslim heritage, is an attorney who has served as US Special Envoy to the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the second largest intergovernmental body after the UN, and as US Special Envoy for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications. Hussain has also served in the White House Counsels Office and on the National Security Council as a political appointee of the Obama Administration. Even though under the Constitution, it is the Presidents job to nominate Supreme Court justices, Obamas selection is already drawing sharp criticism from Republicans. Presidential hopeful Donald Trump told ABC News that he does not agree with the Presidents decision. Hussain is a Muslim and a sympathizer, just like Obama, and now he takes over the legacy the great Antonin Scalia left behind. The President should be ashamed of himself. The American people should have had a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said. Appointing a Muslim to replace Scalia is absolutely appalling. Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she fully supports Obamas decision. We needed someone in there to fill that spot as quickly as possible, Bradley said. Regardless if you agree with Obamas appointed choice of Hussain, Scalia was a disgrace to the Supreme Court. He was a religious radical, a bigot, a racist, against womens rights, gay rights and human rights in general; theres absolutely no reason a person like that should have ever had power like that in the first place. He will always be remembered as being on the wrong side of history. David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes, a website that takes the fun out of stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, who is also currently being sued by Fox News for calling them a fake news site, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing. This type of story, when it goes viral, and we debunk it, we make money, Mikkelson said. We use our cookie-cutter outlines, we copy and paste the original article into ours, type in one or two sentences of original content and then we make hella cash. If it wasnt for people like Internet news satirist Paul Horner, my children wouldnt have been able to go to college. Legal experts believe Republicans will attempt to block Obamas appointee until hes out of office, leaving the court with a gaping vacant seat for nearly a year. Obama has a right to do what he did, but well fight him to the end on this, Tom Downey of the Republican National Lawyers Association told reporters. This will not stand, ya know, this aggression will not stand, man."	Fake
" Donald Trump Introduces New Muslim/Refugee Badges; Nazi-Like Plan Requires All Muslims & Refugees To Wear Badges Like The Jews Did During The Holocaust http://newsexaminer.net/politics/donald-trump-introduces-refugee-muslim-badges/ Washington, DC  During an interview today with Fox News, Donald Trump unveiled plans making it mandatory for all Muslim people and refugees entering this country, along with those currently residing in the U.S., to wear badges on their outer garments at all times. The 2016 presidential candidate says these badges are necessary so refugees and Muslims can easily be identified and monitored. They are a danger to our Christian way of life in America, its that simple, Trump said. The Muslims, they want us dead, we know that for a fact. The refugees are joining ISIS and are pouring into our country like that. They both hate our freedom and way of life, you cant argue that. By enforcing and requiring these possible terrorists to wear badges at all time they can be easily identified and tracked if necessary. This is nothing like the badges the Jews had to wear during the Holocaust, that was different, but you know, its the same thing. These are tough times right now and Im just saying what everyone else is too afraid to say. We can take back America, we just need to work together, its never too late. Trump went further by saying he would put all the Muslims and refugees entering this country on their own land, with critics comparing that to Hitlers concentration camps during World War II. There is no reason we shouldnt put them all on their own land like how we did with the Indians. We know what these people are capable of and I know Im scared, and I know most Americans are too. We need to act now before more innocent lives are lost. Last week Trump told various news sources he would implement databases to track every Syrian refugee, Muslim and mosque in this country. Were going to have to do things that we never did before, Trump said in an interview with Yahoo News. Some people are going to be upset about it, but I think that now everybody is feeling that security is going to rule. Appearing Sunday on ABCs This Week, Trump was asked about the databases. I want a database for the refugees, Trump said. We have no idea who these people are. When the Syrian refugees are going to start pouring into this country, we dont know if theyre ISIS, we dont know if its a Trojan horse. And I definitely want a database and other checks and balances. President Obama has expanded the usual annual ceiling for refugees of 70,000 by an additional 15,000, with 10,000 of those new slots for Syrians. At the outset, officials said this program for Syrian refugees probably would continue beyond one year. But nothing approaching 250,000, which Trump routinely says, is in the works. Historians of the Third Reich and Nazi Holocaust say that these methods of government control paved the way for the acceptance of the Holocaust by German citizens. The German governments policy of forcing Jews to wear identifying badges was but one of many psychological tactics aimed at isolating and dehumanizing the Jews of Europe, directly marking them as being different and inferior to everyone else, Paul Horner of the Holocaust Center said. It allowed for the easier facilitation of their separation from society and subsequent ghettoization, which ultimately led to the deportation and murder of 6 million Jews. What Donald Trump is doing is just the beginning, exactly how Hitler started out. More hate and ignorance is definitely what we dont need in this country right now. Horner continued, The only thing good coming from all of this, is that Trump is keeping comedy writers employed and making cash. This stupid moron is a wet dream for writers of comedy all around the world; its not even fair. He writes the story himself, you just have to report what he did and said and your job is done. I truly hope he gets the Republican nomination, we need to keep this cash cow alive. Hell lose to ANYONE that gets elected on the Democratic side, but until then, we must remember these good times and how backwards him and all of his followers are. The yellow badges that were given to the Jews by the Nazis, was a cloth patch sewn on their outer garments that marked them as Jews in public. Intended or not, it served as a badge of shame, making them easily identifiable."	Fake
" Trump Incensed by National Parks Services Plan To Add Barack Obamas Face To Mount Rushmore http://newsexaminer.net/breaking-news/nps-add-obamas-face-mt-rushmore/ Washington, D.C. (AP)  In a move the Trump administration calls, just another example of American carnage, the National Parks Service admitted today in a press conference they have plans to add the face of former President Barack Obama to the Mount Rushmore National Monument. President Trump found out about the plan three days ago when an aide was accidentally CCed on an NPS email. In a late-night press conference held yesterday, Trump hammered the NPS. This is nothing short of treason, Trump said, slamming his fist against the podium. And where did they get these workers? Mexico? Iraq? Ill be damned if the NPS lets rapists and criminals into our country to deface one of our nations iconic landmarks. Henry Murphy, a spokesman from the NPS, met with reporters this morning in the wake of Trumps scathing criticism. Murphy said the organizations leaders have been planning to add Obamas face for more than six months. The new construction is classified as a progressive renovation of the chunk of rock next to the bust of Abraham Lincoln. It will begin next week, Murphy said. Were hoping to have the project completed by the summer of 2018, just in time for President Trumps impeachment, Murphy said during the press conference. Everything is set. The workers are hired, sketches are done and were ready to launch the project. I dont care what the Trump administration says; weve got funding and were moving forward. When asked how the NPS would pay for the project, Murphy danced around an answer. In a follow-up question, Murphy admitted that the parks service backdoored money from contributions to the Environmental Protection Agencys global-warming research fund. Theres a loophole in legislation that allows the EPA to channel research funds to causes deemed necessary without getting congressional approval, Murphy said. What weve done is fully legal and necessary. Murphy went on to say the NPS channeled the money to an unnamed investor who, according to sources, is the same investor who paid for protesters to block the construction of the Dakota Pipeline project. That investor provided some 300 workers for the Mount Rushmore project; all off the books, according to the NPS. A source close to one of the projects organizers said all but five of the workers double as pipeline protesters. Call it what you want, but we felt like this was the right thing to do, Murphy said. Baracks face was slim enough, our artists told us, to squeeze it in right next to Lincoln. The NPS said they are prepared to launch a series of tweets about the matter in the next few days. Hector Guthrie, one of the artists involved in the project, said he was proud of the work but that there was a lot of battling back and forth about what should and shouldnt be added to the sculpture. A few people in the group were worried about the birther arguments that inevitably would come up once the project is done, Guthrie said. So, we decided to etch Obamas birth certificate across his forehead in both English and Arabic. The letters would be really small, though, so you wouldnt be able to see them unless you were up close."	Fake
" Ted Cruz: I Will Endorse Donald Trump For President If He Makes Masturbation Illegal http://newsexaminer.net/politics/ted-cruz-will-endorse-donald-trump-president-makes-masturbation-illegal/ WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP)  U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) sent shockwaves through the Republican Party today when he announced that he would endorse Donald Trump for President, but only if the GOP nominee would be willing to publicly support a ban on masturbation. The Senator called this The single most important issue facing the country today and that without swift action by the next President the country was doomed to slide down a slippery slope of debauchery and self-satisfaction. Self-love is a silent killer in this country. This needless act of hedonistic indulgence is leading our children down a dark and destructive path. It starts innocently enough with a JC Penney catalogue tucked under your mattress, but it quickly spirals out of control, and before you know it, your mother has to call the coroner because youve died from auto-erotic asphyxiation. Im not saying that we should lock up these one armed bandits and throw away the key; what we need is a compassionate approach that helps these deviants reform and become productive members of society. That is why I believe a prison sentence of three to five years will help motivate these heathens to change their evil ways and stay off the Devils playground for good, Cruz said. Im asking Mr. Trump to acknowledge the severity of this problem, and commit to finding real solutions. If he does that, I will do whatever it takes to help him secure the White House in November. Should Mr. Trump decline, I think its safe to say that all options, including a third party run, are out on the table. Donald Trump told ABC News that he was open to the idea, though he refused to take a clear stand on the issue. Look, do I think Ted Cruz is right about this? Maybe he is, maybe he isnt. To be honest, I dont know a lot about this subject matter. I dont need to. I have a wife that takes care of this for me, and shes a beautiful wife, the best wife, the greatest wife. My people are going to take a hard look into this matter and find a great answer for it, the best answer there is. I want an endorsement from Senator Cruz, and I think I can go along with his request that makes pleasuring your genitalia for non-reproductive purposes illegal. This is not the first time that Cruz has attempted to use his political power to curtail the act of self-stimulation. As solicitor general of Texas in 2007 he fought to uphold the states ban on sex toys by arguing that there was no Right to stimulate ones genitals. Cruz eventually lost this battle, but the story re-surfaced this year and gained widespread media attention, prompting Cruzs former college roommate Craig Mazin to tweet that Cruzs stance against stimulating ones own genitals was A new belief of his, implying that much of Cruzs time in college was, in fact, spent stimulating his own genitals. Another one of Cruzs former college roommates, Matt Daemon, has recently come forward to corroborate Mazins story. All Ted Cruz did was take care of little Ted Cruz back then, which is fine I guess, but he was always real creepy about doing it. Honestly, I lost track of the number of times I came home to find him laying on the couch naked, lotion and Kleenex next to him, watching re-runs of Walker Texas Ranger. He wouldnt even try and cover up when I caught him, he would just stare at me in the eyes and continue until I left the room. Its absolutely hilarious about the tough stance on touching ones self that Ted has taken in this country. I truly believe he may have pulled on it one too many times and it broke or something and now feels that if he cant do it anymore, then no one can. Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, told ABC News that she is sickened by the Republican party. It is absolutely disgusting that in this day in age, a creepy weirdo like Ted Cruz was almost elected as the GOP nomination for President, Bradley said. With all the real problems in this country like starvation, so many people out of work and families living on the street, Cruz is focused on making pleasuring yourself a crime. Bradley continued, Also, I just want to say a big thank you to everyone that has supported our cause in giving new socks to the homeless, it means so much. Please, donate what you can, every bit helps. Cruz, however, remains undeterred by his detractors. When you play with your Devil stick or ring the Devils doorbell you make the angels in heaven weep, and they are weeping for this country 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. America needs strong moral leadership, and I pray that Donald Trump is up to the task. The fate of our great nation is in his hands; hopefully, theyre big enough to handle it. Most pundits expect Trump to answer Cruzs call and demand a stiffer approach to the matter. A recent poll by the New York Times found that 43% of likely Trump voters support a ban on self-stimulation due to moral and religious concerns. Another 46% would be okay with a ban, saying that they, like Trump, have far too many potential suitors, and therefore do not need to satisfy their own urges. Only 11% of Trump supporters are against a ban. RNC political strategist, 37-year-old Paul Horner, calls the move a no-brainer and says that Trump would be foolish to turn his back on Cruz. Conservatives are siding with Cruz overwhelmingly on this issue. If Donald does not side with the Senator, he risks alienating the partys Christian base and opening the door for a third party run by Cruz which would fracture the vote and all but guarantee a victory for Clinton. Trump needs to agree with Cruz on this one, no matter how creepy, insane and absolutely horrible of a person he is. Regardless of which side Trump takes on the issue, it is certain to invoke heated debate on both sides of the political aisle. You can voice your opinion about Cruzs proposal by calling the Senators 24-Hour No Self-Love Hotline at (785) 273-0325."	Fake
" Secret Service Agent Says Obama Is Muslim & Gay In New Tell-All Book http://newsexaminer.net/entertainment/secret-service-agent-says-obama-is-gay-muslim/ Washington, DC  A former Secret Service agent whose new book is quickly climbing Amazons best-seller charts, said he is concerned about the state of the country and says it is time the public knows the real truth about our Commander in Chief, Barack Obama. Former agent, Paul Horner, in his new tell-all book The Black House, reveals what goes on inside the White House when the news cameras are turned off. In an interview with NBC News, Horner told Senior Political Analyst Tom Downey that he is one-hundred-percent positive that President Obama is not only gay, but a radical Muslim as well. Everyone on the inside knows that Obama is gay and a Muslim, it is common knowledge, Horner said. I saw many men coming and going from Obamas room, at all hours. I would say a good portion of the men, over fifty-percent, were Muslim. Downey: In your book you talk about several rituals Obama preformed to unwind from his busy schedule. Can you elaborate on these for our viewers? Horner: When no one was around, except his security, Obama couldnt wait to get out of his suit and into his Muslim tunic. He would wear it while praying to the prophet Muhammad throughout the day. During these prayer sessions he insisted that he not be disturbed. Downey: Your book spends a whole chapter devoted to the various tortures that Obama and the First Lady would subject you to. Can you explain? Horner: Because I was white, Obama would force me to listen to Diana Ross at full volume, every day, at all hours of the night. It was horrible, I never got any sleep. This is one of the main reasons I finally had to quit. Downey: Can you give us any insight on Obamas feelings towards the American people? Horner: He constantly made jokes about Americans, frequently referring to them as mongoloids and idiots. Christians were his favorite verbal punching bags. He has absolutely no respect for the Christian religion. I believe he actually hates Christians, and finds their ideology to be old fashioned and ignorant. Downey: What are some of the things the public will find the most shocking? Horner: Probably the sheer amount of men he welcomed into his bed quarters. I am in no way homophobic, but Obamas insatiable lust for homosexual liaisons is like nothing Ive ever witnessed. Were talking 10-15 partners in a single day. Downey: Thats amazing, 10-15 in a single day? Wow. Horner: Also, at least once a day, Obama would have us log on to Facebook and report a page about a Dolphin named Fappy who travels around the country speaking to elementary school children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation. It was all very, very strange stuff. Downey: Is there anything else you can tell us? Horner: Yeah (Horner smiles), buy the book.

" Newly Leaked Report Shows Hillary DID NOT Win New HampshireAnd Dems Are PANICKING http://usinfonews.com/index.php/2017/09/10/newly-leaked-report-shows-hillary-not-win-new-hampshireand-dems-panicking/ President Trump won the election fair and square, but more and more evidence keeps piling up that his big win might have been in spite of Democratic voter fraud. First there was the study suggesting millions of non-citizens voted, now there appears to be evidence that thousands of non-residents may have actually given a whole state to Hillary Clinton. New Hampshire House Speaker Shawn Jasper (R) reported numbers on Thursday that indicate more than 6,500 people registered to vote in New Hampshire using out-of-state drivers licenses, Washington Times reports. Since the election, many of those people, most of whom were from nearby Massachusetts, never got an in-state license. Some have suggested the states same-day registration rules could be to blame, as people from Massachusetts- a solidly blue state- could travel to New Hampshire, vote, and then leave in one day. White House Policy Advisor Stephen Miller was unsurprised by Jaspers findings, saying: Having worked before on a campaign in New Hampshire, I can tell you that this issue of busing voters into New Hampshire is widely known by anyone whos worked in New Hampshire politics. Its very real. Its very serious. This morning, on this show, is not the venue for me to lay out all the evidence. Leave it to Democrats to travel from miles around just to tell other people how they should be governed, in a state they dont even live in. Heres the three numbers you need to know: 6,540 people registered and voted on the same day- November 8th, by showing out-of-state licenses.  About 5,300 of those people had not received a New Hampshire drivers license or registered a vehicle in New Hampshire several months later.  President Trump lost New Hampshire by 2,736 votes.  This seems like pretty strong evidence of suspicious voting activity, with real consequences for elections. Dont be surprised if you dont hear the media advertise this though, and this absolutely needs to get out there- so SHARE it LOUD and PROUD, Patriots!"	Fake

" Uncovered Voter Fraud In New Hampshire Tipped State For Hillary http://yournewswire.com/voter-fraud-new-hampshire-hillary/ Nearly 7,000 illegal voters were found to have voted for Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire on November 8, according to official figures. 6,540 people registered to vote using out-of-state drivers licenses, the majority of which did not obtain an in-state license nor register a motor vehicle. According to New Hampshire House Speaker Shawn Jasper, the voter fraud that took place last November tipped the State in Hillary Clintons favor. Washingtontimes.com reports: Since Election Day, Republicans have charged that a significant number of nonresident Democrats, principally from Massachusetts, flowed into New Hampshire to vote illegally, tilting a close race to their party. Having worked before on a campaign in New Hampshire, I can tell you that this issue of busing voters into New Hampshire is widely known by anyone whos worked in New Hampshire politics. Its very real. Its very serious. This morning, on this show, is not the venue for me to lay out all the evidence, White House policy adviser Stephen Miller told ABC News in February. Though Mr. Jaspers findings dont prove those accusations, they do corroborate them. The numbers read this way: 6,540 people registered and voted on Nov. 8, based on presenting out-of-state licenses. As of Aug. 30, about 15 percent (1,014 of the voters) had been issued New Hampshire drivers licenses. f the remaining 5,526, barely more than 200 (3.3 percent) had registered a motor vehicle in New Hampshire. New Hampshire law gives drivers 60 days upon establishing residence to obtain a state license. But more than 80 percent of voters who registered on Nov. 8 using out-of-state drivers licenses, or 5,313 of them, neither had a state license nor registered a motor vehicle almost 10 months later. Double voting is illegal, and 196 people are being investigated for casting ballots in New Hampshire and in other states. In the presidential race, Democrat Hillary Clinton defeated Republican Donald Trump in New Hampshire by 2,736 votes. In an even tighter race, for the Granite States U.S. Senate seat, Democratic challenger Maggie Hassan defeated incumbent Republican Kelly Ayotte by 1,017 votes. Logan Churchwell, spokesman for Public Interest Legal Foundation, which investigates voter fraud, said Mr. Jaspers numbers bolster his groups findings that many people vote in New Hampshire without proof of residence. Weve known for months that more voters cast ballots without any proof of actually living in New Hampshire than the differentials for either federal contest there in 2016, he said. Now it looks like they were back in Boston in time to watch the election returns that evening. The left-wing groups suing to block new proof-of-residence laws for same-day voter registration are really proving what drives them to the courthouse. Project Veritas, a conservative investigative unit, took hidden cameras to New Hampshire for the 2016 February primary. Poll workers told Veritas operatives that they did not need to live in the state to vote, that they could use a Massachusetts drivers license and that they could fill out a form if they had no ID. If youre here today, you can vote and be gone, one poll official unwittingly told Veritas. A spokesman for Mr. Jasper said the speaker was presenting raw data and did not know which states issued the 6,540 licenses and acknowledged that the numbers could include some college students. In February, while meeting with senators at the White House, Mr. Trump said he lost New Hampshire because thousands of Massachusetts residents crossed state lines to vote. He also said Ms. Ayotte lost for the same reason: illegal voting. The liberal media dismissed his accusations. The Boston Globe called them groundless. The president has appointed a special commission to investigate voter integrity, led by Vice President Mike Pence. By coincidence, New Hampshire will host the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integritys first meeting outside Washington on Tuesday. Vice Chairman Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state, will preside. Democrats oppose the panel and have called for its demise. At least two scientific surveys show that a larger number of noncitizens register and vote illegally in U.S. elections. One poll found that a large majority vote Democrat. Mr. Jasper said in a statement that he requested the drivers license and motor vehicle information to benefit the legislature in its assessment of the effectiveness of our current election laws as well as future legislation that could improve our voter registration and verification processes. The two state departments, State and Safety, provided the data to Mr. Jasper on Wednesday in a joint letter. Secretary of State William M. Gardner, a Democrat, signed the letter. Also signing was John Barthelmes, the Republican appointed commissioner for the Department of Safety. The two agencies explained the 5,313 number (neither a drivers license nor a registered motor vehicle many months later) with several possible reasons. It is likely that some unknown number of these individuals moved out of New Hampshire, it is possible that a few may have never driven in New Hampshire or have ceased driving, however, it is expected that an unknown number of the remainder continue to live and drive in New Hampshire. If they have established their residence in New Hampshire, they may have failed to obtain a New Hampshire drivers license. Nowhere in the letter do the departments suggest that out-of-state people voted illegally. The letter contains another interesting fact: There were 6,033 people who signed domicile affidavits in order to register to vote. The secretary of state sent letters to all of them, and the U.S. Postal Service returned 458 of them as not delivered to the address on the registration forms."	Fake
" Hurricane Matthew Was Called Hurricane Hillary Until Obama Banned Name http://yournewswire.com/hurricane-matthew-hillary/ Hurricane Matthew, the devastating storm that left a trail of dead in Haiti and the Caribbean last year, was originally named Hurricane Hillary, until the Obama White House intervened and demanded the name changed. There is a strict procedure for naming hurricanes, claims a source at the World Meteorological Organization, and when we saw the storm brewing just east of the Lesser Antilles, we knew she was going to be a real nasty piece of work. We decided to use the name Hurricane Hillary. But the White House caught wind of this and we had to change it real fast. So it became Matthew. Hurricane Matthew, originally dubbed Hurricane Hillary, was powerful and devastating Category 5 Atlantic hurricane that wrought widespread destruction and catastrophic loss of life during its journey across the Western Atlantic, including parts of Haiti, Cuba, and the southeastern United States. According to Wikipedia, a total of 603 deaths were attributed to the storm, including 546 in Haiti, 47 in the United States, 4 in Cuba, 4 in the Dominican Republic, 1 in Colombia, and 1 in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Hurricane Matthew tore through the Caribbean, leaving hundreds of dead people in its wake. Here in the office we still think it should have been named Hurricane Hillary. Hurricanes have been given mens and womens names in the United States since 1978. Senior meteorologists choose names for a given storm from a pre-prepared list of options. For Atlantic hurricanes, there is a list of names for each of six years. In other words, one list is repeated every seventh year. The only time that there is a change is if a storm is so deadly or costly that the future use of its name on a different storm would be inappropriate for reasons of sensitivity. We knew this was going to be a deadly storm and the name would be retired. So we chose Hillary. We didnt expect the White House would ever get involved in the naming of a hurricane. They said, In an election year, are you freaking kidding? Change that name now or you will all be out of jobs. Dont even think of attempting another prank like this."	Fake
" TRUMP KNOCKED UNCONSCIOUS BY MUSLIM MAN POSING AS FOX NEWS REPORTER http://actionnews3.com/trump-knocked-unconscious-muslim-man-posing-fox-news-reporter/ A radical Muslim who attempted to kill a Christian pastor earlier this month was arrested for an attack on President Donald Trump.  According to the United States Secret Service, Ibn Yakoobi was a Muslim extremist who was part of a mob that recently attacked Christians and destroyed their church in Mobile, Alabama in July.  The attack took place today outside of Trump Towers in New York as the President was exiting the building into his presidential motorcade.

" HOSPITAL INSIDER REVEALS THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN MICROCHIPPING BABIES SINCE 1983 http://actionnews3.com/government-microchipping-babies/ There has been a lot of controversy surrounding the RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) device that is said to be upcoming technology that we will see in our near future.  But not as controversial as the report that has come out of Washington DC today.  Hospital workers have come forward with new information that proves to be the largest breach of privacy United States citizens have ever uncovered.  According to several hospital insiders employees have been forced to microchip newborn babies in thousands of hospitals across the United States since 1983.  This small chip, when inserted at birth, can be found implanted in the thumb, or in the back of the neck.  It is as small as a grain of rice, and undetectable outside of the skin.  The serial number on the chip, is then linked to your Social Security number. You have been tracked your entire life.  RFID Microchips are essentially a unique ID embedded in your body, and, as we know, numbers can be stolen and data can be hacked, says University of Wollongong Prof. Katina Michael. They point to an uber-surveillance society that is big brother on the inside looking out. Governments or large corporations have the ability to track peoples actions and movements, and ultimately even control them.   This leaked information is expected to cause a major uproar in citizens of the United States born from 1983 to current.  How will you know if you have it? Can you get it removed? Who is tracking us?  These are the questions hoping to be answered, as we learn more about the governments hidden tactics to control the American Society over the last 32 years."	Fake

However, a new argument has taken flight over the last month that is taking the abortion debate to the next level. The variety in opinion on the issue of abortion is reflected in the diverse views of religious groups, but now pro-lifers are declaring ejaculation is murder and they want strict laws against the practice.   Life begins BEFORE conception. This is why the Catholics do not believe in birth control, said Rachel Stratt, pro-life activist. God made mens semen for a purpose, and you can just waste that purpose by gratifying yourself whenever you want to. Every time you do, you are literally killing thousands of babies! Ejaculation is murder and every sperm cell is a life!  Stratt and her group of protesters are calling for a law that will make ejaculating for self gratification illegal in every state across the country. Millions upon millions of innocent lives are wasted every day while men have lustful thoughts or watch those sick pornos on PornHub. We have got to put a stop to this as a human race. Save the sperm, save the children! A petition on Change.org to stop the needless wasting of sperm through self gratification has already received 85,000 signatures in less than three weeks. The petition needs 100,000 signatures before it is reviewed and responded by the White House.

The judge cited Christmas as his ludicrous answer as to why the feds have the right to allow a man to brutalize his wife for speaking with another man and to beat her nearly to death if she were to act on her impulses. Those laws may be acceptable to savages, but here in America, we have higher standards.  President Trump used an old precedent and an executive order to remove al Allalawaralahali-Smith from the bench, citing gross negligence of his duties and wanton disregard for the United States Constitution. The Muslim can ask for a Congressional hearing if he so desires, but that will likely get him nowhere since he is the first and only person ever to allow the religious doctrine from another culture rule the country.  Democrats are crying foul, saying that since the appointment wasnt Trumps, he cant use the precedent hes using to fire him.

" Obama Crushed After Trump Orders White House To Stop His Sickest Tradition http://thelastlineofdefense.org/obama-crushed-after-trump-orders-white-house-to-stop-his-sickest-tradition/  Obama was seen storming away from the West Wing after staffers from Donald Trumps transition team began preparing the Executive offices for the new administration. On Trumps orders, one of Obamas most secretive rituals is being reversed and all signs of it removed from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.  For the past 7 years, to appease any Muslims working at or visiting the White House, silence has been ordered during the five times of Islamic prayer each day. In addition, prayer rugs and crescent moon symbols are available in several areas of the executive mansion to make Muslims more comfortable.  The administration has defended the practice by asserting that it also observes several other religious moments of silence and prayer out of respect, including a full 15 seconds for Christianity on Sunday morning while a chaplain blesses a staff breakfast. None of the prayer is mandatory or led by a government official, which has allowed the administration to subvert 1st Amendment issues, but the obvious favoritism towards Islam, which is observed for 25 minutes per day seven days a week, tells a story this president has denied for eight years.  President-Elect Trump, who acknowledges that this country was founded by Christians and was built on Christian morals, is having all pagan symbols removed from the property unless they offer some historical significance. Only the cross in the White House chapel will remain for worship. Jim Mergernerlerny, head of the team that will transform the White House from the Obamas home to the Trumps second home, told MSNBC:  Mr. Trump doesnt see the need to provide prayer rugs and false idols is a house built by Christians. Washington DC offers a diverse cultural center for worship of any kind. You wont find any special considerations for Judaism or crucifixes to appease Catholics, either. There is a simple chapel with a single cross on one wall that is suitable for prayer by anyone. Our government doesnt need to be forcing prayer rituals down peoples throats just so we dont offend people looking to blow us up.

But before he came to America, he was the Imam of the Immzdeh Hshem mosque where he preached that all non-Muslims should be converted by force and that Sharia law would one day be the law of the land in every nation. Sharia is and will be the law everywhere, Bahar told a group of 5,000 Muslims in 1997, according to Breitbart News. We will rip the throats of all who do not submit to the will of Allah.

According to the announcement, the law concerning the age of consent will be changed across all 50 states and D.C. Currently the law varies in each state with the age of consent being 16, 17, and 18 years old with age provisions and mistake of age defense clauses. Currently, according to lawyers and court officials across the US, these varying laws cause confusion from state to state. This new law is looking to create a uniformed, understood age of consent factor across the entire country. The lowered age of consent means that an individual can have sex with whomever they wish as long as that person is consenting and they are the same age or older. To have sex with someone under the age of consent is a strict liability crime known as statutory rape. It is often referred to by other names such as sexual assault, sexual misconduct with a child, etc. Many states have age-gap provisions that legalize teen sexuality as long as they are within a certain age range. This new law will do away with that age-gap provision. In all states, dating, hugging, holding hands and kissing are not illegal. In some states, fondling, groping through close or other such things known as third-base is illegal. This new law will make any and all contact legal as long as the child is 13 years of age or older. Now that they have done away with the age-gap provision, a 19-year-old boy can legally have sex with a 13-year-old girl without suffering any legal consequences as long as they both consent to the act."

" New Government Program Provides FREE GAS CARDS To Welfare Recipients http://now8news.com/welfare-gas/ First it was Obama Care, Obama Phones, Obama Weed and now Obama Gas. Yes, you heard that right. The White House has quietly used a provision in the law to roll out a nationwide program of free gas for the poor. According to The Detroit News, the Obama administration is using its authority under the Affordable Care Act to improve transportation routes to hospitals. This would make it possible for welfare recipients to receive these preloaded gas cards. This is a $2 billion a year program that will distribute 40 million gallons of gasoline for FREE each year. It will be dispensed at any gas station that participates in the program by accepting this form of payment. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) will be operating the network.  Over 3,000 gas stations in 38 states have been approved to accept this payment in their stores.Dori Salcido, assistant DHHS Sec. for Public Affairs explained, It is not something we are publicizing very much, for obvious reasons. But under the law we are well within our rights to offer this service and we think its good public policy. How are people supposed to get to the doctors office if they dont have gas in their cars? Health insurance is worthless if you cant make it to your appointments. This is just another fine example of government stepping in and solving big problems.This type of program has worked well in oil-rich nations like Venezuela and Indonesia where they subsidize gas for the poor. However, this practice has never been tried here in the United States. This is causing much controversy with some taxpayers who are upset to see their money subsidizing others. One taxpayer, Ross Blake, shared his thoughts, So basically Im being punished for not living in the ghetto. I have three kids and a mortgage. Life isnt cheap for me either. I could use some free gasoline too. A person like Blake will unlikely be able to use this service cardAccess to this gas card is determined by income, says Ebony Jackson, a caseworker at he Department of Health and Human Services. If you are receiving food stamps or cash assistance from the government, you will be approved. All you need to do is apply. The card will supply anywhere from $50 per month to $150 per month in free gas depending on the individuals income. If they have no income, benefits will max out at $250 per month. This will help the unemployed person go to and from job interview. The gas card scandal was uncovered by Nolan Finley, a conservative Detroit News columnist widely known for his groundbreaking expos on Obama Phones. Finley says, There is a blatant economical bias in the program and that is only one of its many outrageous aspects. The President is only trying to increase his popularity. This is something you normally only see in Third World countries. Ive never been more scared for our democracy."	Fake
" Hillary Clinton Busted in the Middle of Huge Pedophilia Ring Cover Up  At State Department http://24wpn.com/index.php/2017/04/29/hillary-clinton-busted-in-the-middle-of-huge-pedophilia-ring-cover-up-at-state-department-video/ An NBC news report claims that Hillary Clinton, while secretary of state, shut down an investigation into an elite pedophile ring in State Department ranks in order to avoid scandal and protect the careers of high ranking officials and an ambassador. The NBC investigation was broadcast at a time when they were a real news organization rather than a branch of the Democratic Partys PR department, and provided internal State Department memos to back up claims of a massive Hillary Clinton elite pedophile ring cover-up. Serious allegations concerning the State Department, the NBC anchor announced, before launching into the disturbing details that mainstream media would be unable to report on in 2017. According to internal State Department memos the agency might have called off or intervened into investigations into possibly illegal, inappropriate behavior within its ranks allegedly to protect jobs and avoid scandals. This concerns a time when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. There is an old saying in Washington that the cover-up is worse than the crime. But in this case both parts of it are disturbing, Chuck Todd continued.Allegations of prostitution and pedophilia, and allegations that those crimes were somehow covered up or not looked into. So the State Department this morning is having to respond to those claims, and those investigations involve misconduct by State Department officials, including an Ambassador and security agents attached to then secretary of state, Hillary Clinton.The allegations are that these investigations were whitewashed, quashed altogether, and that those orders came from high up. NBC has obtained documents relating to ongoing investigations into some disturbing allegations involving State Department personnel and at least one ambassador. A State Department memo says, quote, the Ambassador routinely ditched his protective security detail in order to solicit sexual favors from both prostitutes and minor children.The memo also says a top State Department official directed State Department investigators to cease the investigation into the ambassadors conduct. Its just one of what another document describes as several examples of undue influence from top State Department officials. Elite pedophile ring In contrast to Clintons cover-up, President Trump has announced a federal investigation into the elite pedophile scandal involving human trafficking earlier this month and promised to help put an end to the horrific, really horrific crimes taking place. The president held a short, dramatic press conference after meeting with human trafficking experts to announce that he will direct the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies to devote more resources and personnel to the investigation. Appearing at the press conference for less than two minutes, President Trump said that the issue has been on the radar of federal government for some time but since taking office in January the investigation has become much more focused. It has been much more focused over the last four weeks, I can tell you that."	Fake
" SEALS Needed To Protect Trump From Assassination After What He Just BOLDLY Risked His Life To Do http://theexaminer.site/2017/07/28/seals-needed-protect-trump-assassination-just-boldly-risked-life/  When Donald Trump ran for office as a non-career politician his allegiance to the American people and not special interest groups or big donors was clear. He perpetually shows his patriotism to the United States and commitment to citizens counting on him. President Trump knows that being the leader of this nation comes at a huge cost in many different ways, but was worth the price to restore this country he loves. In the six months since hes been in office, everything hes done has been in the best interest of the American people which has caused a huge but needed, upheaval in Washington, D.C.  The establishment in Washington doesnt like someone like Trump in the greatest position of control since he poses a risk of exposing political secrets. At the root of power is money and when thats threatened, people tend to do desperate things. Weve seen this with the ever-increasing body count of people tied to the Clintons and their various political scandals, who seemed to have information that this political power couple didnt want out. It has also been theorized that former President John F. Kennedy wrote his death warrant because of a move he was brave enough to make as Commander-in-Chief that some believe led to his assassination. If this was truly the case and history repeats itself, President Trump could need protection from Special Operations to ensure his safety after what hes rumored to be risking his life to do.  Despite the differences in their political affiliation, Kennedy and Trump have a lot of similarities as presidents. According to PragerU, both want lower taxes for Americans, oppose abortion, supported gun rights, and they each sincerely support a strong military. In addition to the Constitution-honoring ideas, they have both expressed a desire to look into the Federal Reserve.  Some believe that Kennedys interesting in ending the Fed is what led to his assassination to avoid that from happening, although this is unsubstantiated and still considered a conspiracy theory. He was hardly past his first thousand days in the White House when he was assassinated in Dallas on November 22, 1963, AnonHQ reported. Competing conclusions of the Warren Commission, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the House Select Committee on Assassinations, and a team of retired secret service officers have failed to provide clarity over the precise circumstances of JFKs assassination  even after 53 years.  The theory comes from a speech he gave in his first 100 days which some say sealed his fate, with thoughts on transparency and honesty in government that sound extremely familiar to what were seeing with our assertive and capable leader today. Most specifically and important is the shared interest that Kennedy and Trump have in creating real checks and balances within the Federal Reserve.  AnonHQ explains of Kennedys last speech before his assassination:  He didnt want to censor the news, to stifle dissent, to cover up government mistakes or to withhold from the press and the public the facts they deserved to know. He wanted the press to inform, to arouse, to reflect, to lead, and to even anger public opinion. The hard hitting speech obviously didnt go down well with the system and the powerful elite at the helm who felt threatened by JFKs ideas.  Then, on June 4, 1963, John F. Kennedy signed Executive Order 11110. The order called for the issuance of $4,292,893,815 in United States Notes through the U.S. treasury rather than the Federal Reserve System  the central banking system of the United States, which is neither federal nor a system owned by the government; it is a private entity.  While it has been said that Kennedy wanted to end the Federal Reserve and many have wondered if this idea led to his assassination to protect the those who they feel must profit from this organization, this government agency hasnt been looked at since. Now, with Trump in office, a bill has been put forth to audit this agency, which would be history-making if his passes.  A bill that Republicans have been attempting to push through the House is gaining new momentum under President Trump. The crafters of Americas government decided hundreds of years ago that we would operate with three branches of equal power, creating a system of checks and balances.  As our government has expanded, some oversight has been lost. Laws have been created to keep transparency out of certain parts of government operations, although some debate this assertion.  For years, House Republicans have attempted to create an auditing system that would break through the veil of secrecy inside the Federal Reserves monetary policy.  Senator Rand Paul, is a huge advocate for this bill. He believes that the Government Accountability Office should have oversight into how the Fed deals with foreign banks and many other issues where the Fed has complete autonomy. Because our government is so large and empowered, there has to be some oversight in how they operate.  Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen completely disagrees with this bill, claiming that she feels oversight will politicize the Fed and cause far more harm than good. President Trump has heaped scorn on the Fed, saying that it lacks oversight on how it deals with interest rates and that affect the overall economy. Our president doesnt make excuses for what he thinks needs to be done, he moves forward with what he genuinely feels is in the best interest of Americans and the future of our country. Share if you agree that there needs to be more transparency within the Federal Reserve!"	Fake

No, they dont want to live the American dream, but take it. Most Muslims come to this country to shoot and run over innocent people just because they want. America went through hell during Obamas presidency, because the former president didnt fight against terrorists. Moreover, he armed them. Have you ever seen Obama do anything to blast terrorists? No, he supported Muslims and gave them more rights than Americans will ever have. Now Muslims are trying to plant their Sharia law in every institution across the country. Is this what Obama referred to when he said that Muslims are here to assimilate? This law is the most terrible of them all. According to this law, you can get killed for being a gay, and rape victims cant do anything to punish rapists. Can you believe this? President Donald Trump will never allow anything like this, and he was clear about this during his presidential campaign. The good news is that the House passed a new bill that bans the application of foreign law. Democrats and Muslims arent quite happy about it, and they complain that the new bill only targets Muslims, and approves xenophobia and racism. Really? Weve heard a lot of discussions about this being a religious law and specifically directed at preventing Sharia law and I just dont read it that way, explained Republican Theresa Hamilton. Sandy Montgomery had a similar opinion. We have allowed legal immigrants, illegal immigrants and now refugees to take advantage of our law and culture to take up their own agendas. They have no intention to abide by our laws, nor are they interested in assimilating to our culture, she said. What do you think about this bill? Will Muslims protest again?   "	Fake

He was very close with the Supreme Court Justice Scalia.  He then announced huge news that nobody saw coming  Judge Andrew Napolitano stated that the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia confided in him that he was under the impression that Barack Obama had put the highest and most important court in the land under the eye of the NSA.  Justice Scalia told Napolitano that he frequently thought the court was being watched. And he stated to him that around four or five years ago.  Napolitano said. If they had to unmask Senator Pauls name to reveal a conversation he was having with a foreign agent and the foreign agent was hostile to the United States they can do that. Thats not what hes talking about. Theyre talking about unmasking him when hes having a conversation with his campaign manager when hes running in the Republican primary.  He went on to say that Obama should be subpoenaed to testify, even though he would lie about it if he saw the unmasked intelligence.  The Obama administration watching the Supreme Court means they had no qualms about watching everyone that didnt support every moronic step they made.  Constantly selling this nation down the river to our enemies and Obama found it appropriate to watch everyone else because he was untrusting. He was untrusting because he was untrustworthy.  Its now wondered that if Scalia was killed to keep things quiet. The autopsy wont be done now, and the late Justice deserves to rest in peace.  Napolitano making that announcement is just another piece of damning evidence against Obama and his minions.  Good job Obama. Way to violate the Constitution every way you could."	Fake

This drives the Left nuts.After Obama's disastrous Iranian deal, Trump will clean up the mess. The mainstream media was too soft on Obama's anti-American deal. They almost completely ignored it. We need to make sure this never happens again, so we need to replace the RINOs with true conservatives, and we need to replace the Democrats. Cryin' Chuck Schumer needs to be replaced with a pro-American conservative.Hezbollah has only gotten stronger because of Obama. We need to protect our friends in Israel from these radicals.

Hoitenga introduced the law after a Muslim doctor was arrested in Detroit for committing female genital mutilation. Patients had been driving in from all over Michigan to receive the Muslim doctors treatments. If enacted, Hoitengas bill would limit the application and enforcement by a court, arbitrator, or administrative body of foreign laws that would impair constitutional rights; to provide for modification or voiding of certain contractual provisions or agreements that would result in a violation of constitutional rights; and to require a court, arbitrator, or administrative body to take certain actions to prevent violation of constitutional rights, and would apply only to actual or foreseeable violations of the constitutional rights of a person caused by the 16 application of the foreign law.

The more information you find out about Democratic IT scammer Imran Awan-the more you find out about the profile of a bold and careless criminal mind.Imran Awan was Debbie Wasserman Schultzs aide for thirteen years since she started working as a Florida representative in 2004. He was fired last week and continued to play her IT expert even when he was living in Pakistan.Accessing specific computer network without permission, also known as hacking, was the crime act that the three Pakistani brothers, who managed the IT affairs for several Democratic government officials, have committed.Imran Awan, who started working for Wasserman Schultz in 2005, received $164,600 in 2016, with close to $20,000 of that coming from Wasserman Schultz. His brother Jamal, who started working as a staffer in 2014, was paid $157,350.12 in 2016. Abid, who started working in 2005, was paid $160,943 in 2016. Imrans wife, Hina Alvi, who was employed as a staffer since February 2007, was paid 168,300 in 2016. Rao Abbas was paid $85,049 in 2016. Abid, Imran, and Jamal Awan were barred from computer networks at the House of Representatives in February. Most of the House Members fired the Awans afterwards, while Imran Awan was still receiving payments from Debbie Wasserman Shultz until he was arrested for Bank Fraud after attempting to flee the country. The other members of the family left the country and moved to Pakistan together with hundreds of thousands of tax-payer money they mysteriously were able to wire. Democrats could be compromised by the Awans and Sensitive information revealed to foreign Enemies! (Muslim Brotherhood  Yemen Raid with dead soldier for example? Most of them have Seats on Committees that deal with highly sensitive information. According to Redditt  Imran Awan is now released with an GPS ankle monitor until his preliminary hearing on Aug. 21. Awan pretended to be his wife when issued a request for a loan from the Congressional Federal Credit Union and got it! He had the credit union wire $165,000 to PAKISTAN  no questions asked. Andrew McCarthy at National Review reported: Bank fraud was the stated charge on which Awan was arrested at Dulles Airport this week, just as he was trying to flee the United States for Pakistan, via Qatar. That is the same route taken by Awans wife, Hina Alvi, in March, when she suddenly fled the country, with three young daughters she yanked out of school, mega-luggage, and $12,400 in cash. By then, the proceeds of the fraudulent $165,000 loan theyd gotten from the Congressional Federal Credit Union had been sent ahead. It was part of a $283,000 transfer that Awan managed to wire from Capitol Hill. He pulled it off  hilariously, if infuriatingly  by pretending to be his wife in a phone call with the credit union. Told that his proffered reason for the transfer (funeral arrangements) wouldnt fly, Mrs. Awan promptly repurposed: Now she was buying property. Asking no more questions, the credit union wired the money . . . to Pakistan.Congressional-staff salaries are modest, in the $40,000 range. For some reason, Awan was paid about four times as much. He also managed to get his wife, Alvi, on the House payroll . . . then his brother, Abid Awan . . . then Abids wife, Natalia Sova. The youngest of the clan, Awans brother Jamal, came on board in 2014  the then-20-year-old commanding an annual salary of $160,000. A few of these arrangements appear to have been sinecures: While some Awans were rarely seen around the office, we now know they were engaged in extensive financial shenanigans away from the Capitol. Awan also threatened and tried to extort cash from his stepmother after his fathers death. The Daily Caller reported: Their own stepmother, a devout Muslim, called police in Virginia and said they used high-tech devices to wiretap her home and tried to extort her into signing papers that would give them access to cash stored in Pakistan in their deceased fathers name. The stepmother, Samina Gilani, said in court documents that Imran said he was very powerful and would have her loved ones kidnapped in Pakistan. Court records show that their father changed his last name, and two relatives said that was because he detested illegal behavior by his sons. In public lawsuits in Fairfax County, Va., the brothers have been accused of life insurance fraud as well as fraud involving a car dealership. This is a description of a complete slimeball. Who kicks his stepmother out of her home when she has just lost her husband? The more you read about Imran Awan the more you see the picture of a complete soulless criminal. So why was he hanging around Wasserman Schultz for 13 years? Now thisFederal officials are investigating whether sensitive information was passed from Imran Awan to the Russian or Pakistani governments.The New York Post reported: Federal authorities are investigating whether sensitive data was stolen from congressional offices by several Pakistani-American tech staffers and sold to Pakistani or Russian intelligence, knowledgeable sources say. What started out 16 months ago as a scandal involving the alleged theft of computer equipment from Congress has turned into a national-security investigation involving FBI surveillance of the suspects. Investigators now suspect that sensitive US government data  possibly including classified information  could have been compromised and may have been sold to hostile foreign governments that could use it to blackmail members of Congress or even put their lives at risk.

" DEPLORABLE: Hillary Clinton Admits Shes Looking For a Way to REMOVE Trump From Office https://conservativepost.com/deplorable-hillary-clinton-admits-shes-looking-for-a-way-to-remove-trump-from-office/ Its apparently not enough for Hillary Clinton to get away with her catalogue of crimes. Now she wants to overturn a US presidential election because she didnt win. If that sounds childish, its because it is. Its also undemocratic and un-American. But at this point, whos counting any longer when it comes to Hillarys list of flaws? Speaking to NPRs Terry Gross, Hillary openly admitted that shed love to find a way to overturn the election and remove Trump from office, and is listening to any and every idea along those lines. During their conversation, Hillary said she wouldnt rule out challenging the results of the 2016 election. The shocked Gross pressed Hillary to acknowledge what she had said. Youre not going to rule it out? she asked. This is totally unprecedented in every way. The presidential election loser confirmed that no, I wouldnt rule it out. For the time being, Hillary admits that I dont know if theres any legal, constitutional way to do that. Even so, the very fact that shes open to such a move is just incredible. Unprecedented, as Gross pointed out. And definitely DEPLORABLE, to use one of Hillarys favorite words."	Fake
" Look How the UN Reacted When President Trump Openly Slammed Socialism https://conservativepost.com/look-how-the-un-reacted-when-president-trump-openly-slammed-socialism/ Trumps first address to the UN General Assembly as President of the United States was highly anticipated. And none were so eager as true American patriots. We just knew Trump would lay some massive truth bombs not the international community, and he didnt disappoint! At one point, Trump took direct aim at the socialism that is so anathema to true American democracy, but which had been championed by our previous president, Barack Hussein Obama. Addressing the crisis in Venezuela, Trump said: I ask every country represented here today to be prepared to do more to address this very real crisis. We call for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela. The assembly applauded, if not only to be polite. And then Trump dropped the hammer: The problem in Venezuela is not that socialism has been poorly implemented, but that socialism has been faithfully implemented. BOOM! The problem, as Trump so rightly noted, is socialism itself, a system that too easily lends itself to megalomaniacs and dictators. And how did the UN General Assembly react? Stoney silence.  Follow Bill O'Reilly @billoreilly Most fascinating part of Trump #UNGA speech: after lambasting socialism, he paused, perhaps waiting for applause. None came. Stony silence. Most of the nations represented there knew Trump had just called them out, big time. And we couldnt be more proud of our president. Can you imagine Barack Obama ever taking such a bold stand? Of course not."	Fake
" What Obama Did Yesterday on Wall Street Makes Even His Own Friends Hate Him https://conservativepost.com/what-obama-did-yesterday-on-wall-street-makes-even-his-own-friends-hate-him/ Democrats and mainstream media have done the impossible to attack Trump and let the public forget how bad Obama was as a president. Nevertheless, what Obama just did is the perfect opportunity to show the Dems how bad hes is. Obama decided to go to Wall Street and took $1.2 Million for speeches at just 3 banks this month. The same thing that Hillary did for years. Yeah, after he made $50 million on a book. No shocking thing for us to learn that he would be selling out to the same people that he used to talk sh*t on when campaigning to become president. Thats not all  Obama is starting his own Leadership summit in Chicago (like the Clinton Global Initiative). Democrats coming to together to bash Trump and investing money to gain back America.

" Just In : President Trump Makes Major White House Change That Has Even Libs Speechless https://conservativepost.com/just-in-president-trump-makes-major-white-house-change-that-has-even-libs-speechless/ President Trump promised fiscal responsibility within government, using tax-payer monies wisely. And he is delivering on that promise. On Sunday, it was announced that the Trump administration is cutting its own budget by $22 million  in effect, Trump is leading the way by cutting funds to the White House, his current residence. The Democrat party and the mainstream media have been oddly quiet about this big change Breitbart reports: The savings come from a cut in the amount spent on Michelle Obamas budget as First Lady, an end to the large number of czars and so-called fellowships that Obama employed, and a smaller White House workforce, Forbes magazine reported. After the White House released its annual budget report last week, Adam Andrzejewski, president of government watchdog group OpenTheBooks.com, compared the newly reported budget to the last two years of the Obama administration. Andrzejewski (pronounced And-gee-eff-ski) noted that there are now 110 fewer White House employees since Obama left office, saving nearly $5 million alone. Also, the First Ladys staff has been cut from 24 staffers to only five. Michelle Obama entered the White House with a staff of 22 costing nearly $2 million annually, up from the $1.4 million spent during the George W. Bush era. Another area of savings was the elimination of the so-called policy czars with which Obama stocked the White House staff. The Trump budget shows not a single czar employed for 2017. Trump also seems to have ended Obamas shady fellowship positions, people responsible for such special programs as Michelle Obamas Let Girls Learn initiative and others. Some of these fellowship candidates in Obamas administration made up to $158,000 annually."	Fake
" US Begs Russia For Mercy In Syria After Germany Opens American War Crime Investigation http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/index2386.htm By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers A new Ministry of Defense (MoD) report circulating in the Kremlin today states that after Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov agreed to yesterdays telephonic conference with US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the Americans begged for mercy for their Islamic terrorist forces illegally operating in Syriabut that the MoD ignored by its continuing to obliterate these US-backed terror fighters with massive air power, with Syrian military forces, likewise, ignoring these US-backed militants by rushing pass them as they rapidly advanced across the Euphrates Riverwhile at the same time, Germany has opened a criminal probe into the US illegally supplying these terrorists with weapons.  [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.] Want to know more?  Click HERE. According to this report, during the emergency meeting held in Helsinki (Finland) requested by the US this past week, both Russia and America agreed that the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) should be implemented without exception as a first bid to stop World War IIIand with the Americans further agreeing that their terrorist forces operating in Syria would not enter the eastern city of Deir ez-Zorthe battle for which the MoD had previously labeled as the Battle For The Monastery that they warned will decide the fate of the world. Major General of the Syrian Republican Guard Issam Zahreddine (arms crossed), and his top female aide (cigarette in hand), talk with civilians in the eastern city of Deir ez-Zor on 10 September as they continue to press forward with Russian air cover in the offensive against ISIS and US-backed terrorists across the province.  [Note: Americans arent allowed to know about the woman commanders in the Syrian Army fighting Islamic terrorists.] The United States total capitulation on Syria, this report explains, is due to their fears over the shocking investigative findings made by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN) released this past week detailing how the US has been illegally funneling billons-of-dollars of arms into this conflict zone causing the needless deaths of hundreds-of-thousands, and as they described: The Pentagon has relied on an army of contractors and sub-contractors  from blue-chip military giants to firms linked to organized crime  to supply up to US$ 2.2 billion worth of Soviet-style arms and ammunition to Syrian rebels fighting a sprawling war against the Islamic State (ISIS). Arms factories across the Balkans and Eastern Europe  already working at capacity to supply the Syrian war  are unable to meet the demand. In response, the US Department of Defense (DoD) has turned to new suppliers like Kazakhstan, Georgia, and Ukraine for additional munitions while relaxing standards on the material its willing to accept, according to an investigation by the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN) and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP). The Syrian rebels supplied with these illegal US arms, this report explains, are mainly the al Qaeda linked Al-Nusra Front, and against whom, in 2014, the United Nations passed a resolution stating that all member states shall prevent the direct or indirect supply sale or transfer to ISIL and Al-Nusra and associated individuals and groups, of arms and related materials. Aside from grossly violating this UN resolution not arm these Islamic terror fighters, this report notes, the United States, also, violated German law by secretly transporting these illegal weapons through that European nation onto the battlefields of Syriaand that the German prosecutors office in Kaiserslautern has now opened a criminal investigation into. Upon the OCCRP and BIRN releasing their shocking investigative findings detailing how the United States was committing a grave war crime by funneling these illegal weapons to radical Syrian Islamic terrorists, this report further notes, the US mainstream propaganda media immediately blocked this information from being known to the American peoplebut after this stunning information went viral on the internet bypassing these propagandists, the CIA funded technology giant Google ordered its YouTube video service division to immediately erase every single Syrian War videoas these videos proved where the weapons being used by Islamic terrorists came from and the horror they inflicted on innocent peoples. Acting as insane as ever too, this report continues, the true intentions of the United States towards Syria are not yet able to be deciphered by any normal mind eitheras nearly immediately after the Americans begged for mercy for their Islamic terrorist forces facing annihilation in Syria, and agreed to keep them from entering Deir ez-Zor, both OCCRP and BIRN shockingly discovered that the Trump administration was budgeting another $600 million in illegal arms sales to these Islamic terrorists in order to keep this war ongoingand with US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, also, continuing the critically flawed US policy that states America will not be satisfied as long as Syrian President Bashar Assad is in power. Syrian President Assad himself, this report details, exposed this critical flaw in US foreign policy in 2015 when he stated: Western propaganda has, from the very beginning, been about the cause of the problem being the president. Why? Because they want to portray the whole problem in Syria lies in one individual; and consequently the natural reaction for many people is that, if the problem lies in one individual, that individual should not be more important than the entire homeland. So let that individual go and things will be alright. Thats how they oversimplify things in the West. From convincing the American people through the propaganda technique of Hitlerization that everything would be peaches and brandy in Iraq if only Saddam Hussein was removed from power, and wine and roses would flourish in Libya once Muammar Gaddafi was gone, and everything in North Korea would be grand if only Kim Jong-un was deposed, and Venezuela would become a paradise on Earth if only President Nicolas Maduro was overthrown, and Russia, too, would be Gods gift to the world if only President Putin was killed, this report continues, this mental insanity employed by the United States against its own citizens to believe such childish things would be laughable, except that its caused hundreds-of-thousands of needless deaths, not to mention the tens-of-millions of lives shattered by this madness the world over. Put more bluntly, though, this report says, Chairwoman of the Federation Council Valentina Matviyenko warns that this childish and insane American foreign policy of believing that only a single person in any nation controls its outcome is like playing with fireand who further warned about these insane Americans by stating: They are using various means of political and economic pressure; they launch color revolutions and even direct military invasions. The rhetoric centered on protection of democracy can hardly fool anyone now. The reason behind such operations by the USA and their allies is their desire to maintain their dominant position in the world.  As far as the export of democracy is concerned, it only brings other peoples chaos, disasters and wars. No nation or group of nations can claim the title of carriers of the only authentic and model democracy that should be copied by the rest of the world. There cant be pupil nations and tutor nations, every state and every people has the right to its own choice of democracy model, without any outside interference. Chairwoman of the Federation Council Valentina Matviyenko And in order to insure that the Syrian people have the right to their own government without any outside interference, this report continues, Russian submarines two days ago fired a massive missile barrage that obliterated some of the last Islamic terrorist command-and-control centers in Syria that quickly caused over 1,000 US-backed Islamic terrorist to switch sides and join the Syrian Army, while at the same time, Iraqi forces launched a massive offensive to destroy ISIS terrorists on their side of the Syrian borderthus allowing the Russian Reconciliation Centre in Syria to establish yet another ceasefire zone free from conflict. Because of Russia freeing Syria from the barbaric rule of these US-backed Islamic terrorists, this report details, over 600,000 Syrian people have been able to return to their homes under the rule of the supposed brutal dictator President Assadand which the US mainstream propaganda media still refuses to tell the American people about because these truthful facts dont support their insane, and highly distorted, narrative that every leader in the world they dont like is a madman hated by his people and only worthy of death. Syrian girl-child celebrates President Assad and Russian liberation of Deir-ez-Zor, 10 September 2017 And as always too, this report concludes, instead of the US mainstream propaganda media telling any truth to the American people about anything, they are, instead, using the same demonization tactics used against other world leaders they detest against their own President Donald Trumpand as evidenced by their outrageously spending more media time bemoaning Trumps tweet about the ISIS terror attack in London yesterday than actually explaining why it happenedand one of their main communistic spokesman Bill Maher, too, just hours ago, shockingly proclaiming that because none of Trumps properties were damaged by Hurricane Irma, it proved that there is no God.

" Bombshell: New Evidence Suggest We Are Not Being Told Everything About Charlottesville http://24wpn.com/index.php/2017/08/19/bombshell-new-evidence-suggests-we-are-not-being-told-everything-about-charlottesville/ One unidentified officer in Charlottesville, VA has come forward and break his silence on the truth behind the events at Charlottesville, according to video via Headlines in Voice. He is suggesting that what took place in Charlottesville was not only allowed to happened, but was intentional and had been planned to happen since May. The officer said that the Charlottesville P.D were instructed to bring radical left and right groups together in one area before being told to stand down. Which suggests that it was someones intentions to start a violent race-based war at the protest. These are his words:The above video states the following, We [Charlotesville police] were ordered to bring the rival groups together. As soon as they were in contact with each other, we were told to stand down. It was outrageous. We werent allowed to arrest anyone without asking the mayor first. We werent even allowed to stop the driver as he sped away. The event was being set up as far back as at least May and it went like clockwork. Michael Signer, the mayor of Charlottesville, ordered police to stand down during the most chaotic and destructive period of the protests  despite police protests against the orders. We wanted to do our job and keep the peace. But these mother******s in charge really want to destroy America. Mayor Signer and other city officials appeared to have let this happen. Fox News reporter Doug McKelway was on the scene and had a similar account of the scene. I can say, having been in Emancipation Park from early on that morning, that what I saw with my own two eyes confirms what this law enforcement source told us. At least from all visible appearances. We saw people coming out of that park who had head wounds, who were bleeding from the head, people walking into that park with bats, with sticks  you saw what they were wearing  helmets, body armor, they had come  and this pertains to both sides  they had come to do damage.. you cannot help but notice from that video that police had been more pro-active, they could have potentially calmed this thing down to some degree. In This 38 second video, officers are seen simply observing Fields drive his battered car away from the destruction he caused. They make absolutely NO effort to stop the car that is maybe 2 yards away from them. As you can see, not a single bit of effort to stop the car. Very fishyLastly, [Mayor] Michael Signer is a Virginia Democratic activist who has close ties with Barrack Obama and John Podesta.

" Perjury! 100% Proof Comey Lied to Congress https://conservativepost.com/perjury-100-proof-comey-lied-to-congress/ 18 U.S. Code  1621  Perjury generally Whoever 1. having taken an oath before a competent tribunal, officer, or person, in any case in which a law of the United States authorizes an oath to be administered, that he will testify, declare, depose, or certify truly, or that any written testimony, declaration, deposition, or certificate by him subscribed, is true, willfully and contrary to such oath states or subscribes any material matter which he does not believe to be true; or 2. in any declaration, certificate, verification, or statement under penalty of perjury as permitted under section 1746 of title 28, United States Code, willfully subscribes as true any material matter which he does not believe to be true; is guilty of perjury and shall, except as otherwise expressly provided by law, be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both. This section is applicable whether the statement or subscription is made within or without the United States. Elder Patriot  CNNs admission today that President-elect Donald Trump had indeed been wiretapped raises a serious question as to just who is in the business of spreading conspiracy theories. It also suggests that Former F.B.I. Director James Comey deliberately perjured himself when he appeared before a House subcommittee and denied any knowledge that Donald Trump  first as a candidate and then as the president  had been wiretapped. When President Trump tweeted that he had been wiretapped while in Trump Tower the media tried painting him as a conspiracy nut. CNN pounced on Trump for starting a conspiracy theory and that the wiretapping claim was an incendiary idea.  CNN was only the tip of the spear.  MSNBC, NBC, ABC, CBS, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The L.A. Times, the entirety of the Deep State controlled mainstream media all joined in discrediting the newly elected president. A full 42 days before Trumps tweet, the NY Times was the first to report that he had been wiretapped.  That was before it was decided that it would be best to deny it ever happened because they found nothing incriminating. That may not be illegal for a newspaper, especially a rag like the Times, but it is for any member of our intelligence community. The fact that the wiretaps turned up nada meant that Obama had convinced the FISA court to give the NSA and the FBI a fishing license for political purposes.  That is the way the Soviet Union operated against their political enemies. In the United States our government is prevented from opening investigations without just cause.  At least we thought so.  Foolish us.  After the IRS scandal why would we trust the Obama administration to play it straight on anything else?  Shame on us. Essentially the mainstream media chose to twist the emerging facts into knots once it became obvious that James Comey was lying to protect his illegal use of FISA court warrants under orders from President Obama. From March 5th through March 21st we laid out the case in thirteen columns that Trump had been wiretapped for political reasons, Obama knew about it, and that Trump had trapped Comey into perjuring himself. For our efforts we were castigated and the social media giants crushed the reach of our articles.  Weve come to recognize that were on to something big whenever the social media platforms begin limiting the number of people who get to view our work. Today our investigative work was vindicated.  The mainstream media, led by CNN, was forced to admit that the U.S. government, under President Barack Obama, had wiretapped Donald Trumps former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, including his conversations with President Trump  both during after the 2016 presidential campaign. That leaves Comey facing a perjury charge for lying, under oath, that Trump had never been wiretapped. There is simply no possibility that Comey, as director of the F.B.I. wasnt aware that Trump Tower had been wiretapped.  If that had happened without Comeys knowledge it was his job to bring the violators to justice. Not so shockingly, Comeys obfuscation wasnt isolated.  Another Deep State operative standing in direct opposition to Trump, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper also denied any knowledge of the wiretapping. If that is the case then who in the hell went before the FISA court, got the authorization from another of Obamas crooked judges, and then executed the taps?  Question: Why isnt anyone in any of the 17 intelligence agencies asking this question? Answer: Because the government long ago stopped answering to We the People."	Fake
" Trump Wins Dangerous Pakistan Gambit That Spells Total Doom For US Democratic Party http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/index2384.htm An intriguing Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin today reveals that President Donald Trump has pulled off one the most dangerous gambit deals [an action entailing a degree of risk calculated to gain an advantage] ever attempted in modern American political history when he pitted a $225 million military aid package to Pakistan against that nations Inter-Services Intelligence (IS) spy agency to pressure them into agreeing to immediately surrender a Pakistani woman to US authoritiesand whose testimony could very well spell the total doom of the entire American Democratic Party.  [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.] According to this report, President Trumps gambit deal with Pakistan began on 6 April 2017 when the United States Capitol Police (USCP) filed a mysterious report that stated:  On 4/6/2017 at 0021 hours, with the building closed to the public, AOC informed USCP Rayburn offices of an unattended bag in the phone booth on the 2nd floor. The officer received the open-contents visible bag and prepared a found property report. While reviewing the inventory of the bag contents, the officer found   #1 a Pakistani ID card with the name Mohommed Ashraf Awan   #2 a copy  not original  of a drivers license with name Imran Awan   #3 a copy (front and back) of his congressional ID   #4 an Apple laptop with the homescreen initials RepDWS (Representative Debbie Wasserman-Shultz)  #5 composition notebooks with notes handwritten saying attorney client privilege and possibly discussing case details below   #6 loose letters addressed to US Attorney of DC discussing the apparent owner of the bag being investigated.   Approximately 3-4 months ago officer was requested by SAA as police presence of 4 individuals being interviewed, including the bag owner. It is unknown to the officer whether he is still employed.  Mohommed Ashraf Awan, this report explains, had previously been identified by the SVR as being a deep cover Pakistani IS operative who had embedded himself within the Democratic Party establishment working under his Americanized name of Imran Awanand who was the top computer information technology specialist for disgraced former Democratic National Committee (DNC) chairman, and US Congresswoman, Debbie Wasserman-Schultz.  Labeled previously by the SVR as a radical Islamic spy master, this report details, Imran Awan first infiltrated the US Congress in January 2004 when he became the information technology director for Democratic Party US Congressman Robert Wexlerand who, also, over these past nearly 13 years, infiltrated into the US Congress his wife, Hina Alvi, and his brothers Abid and Jamalwith Jamal, at just 20 years old, being given by the Democratic Party in the US Congress the outlandish yearly salary of $160,000. The Imran Awan spy ring operating within the US Capitol under the protection of the Democratic Party, this report continues, began to unravel this past February (2017) when they were linked to the death of Navy SEAL William Ryan Owens whose secret raid details were leakedand whom President Trump quickly retaliated against.  With President Trumps forces closing in on them, this report notes, Imran Awans wife Hina Alvi, on 5 March, was able to flee the United States with other members of her familywhile Imran Awan stayed behind to liquidate their families vast real estate holdings made possible by the $9 million paid to them by the Democratic Party and US Congressbut who himself was successfully captured by US federal forces on 24 July when he had attempted to flee toobut who was arrested because he pretended to be his wife when requesting a loan from the US Congressional Federal Credit Uniongot the loan, and then had this credit union wire $165,000 to Pakistanwith no no questions asked.  Even after his wife Hina Alvi had fled to Pakistan, this report continues, Congresswoman Wasserman-Shultz continued paying Imran Awan up the very day of his arrestand that she fully intended on continuing to pay him should he have successfully been able to flee. As to why Congressman Wasserman-Shultz and her Democratic Party continued to pay Imran Awan, this report explains, was due to their fears of what he knewand that was everything as he had installed a secret server to capture every single US Congress document produced, including intelligence filesand as astonishingly described the Washington D.C. based Daily Caller News Service:  Now-indicted former congressional IT aide Imran Awan allegedly routed data from numerous House Democrats to a secret server. Police grew suspicious and requested a copy of the server early this year, but they were provided with an elaborate falsified image designed to hide the massive violations.  The falsified image is what ultimately triggered their ban from the House network Feb. 2, according to a senior House official with direct knowledge of the investigation.  The secret server was connected to the House Democratic Caucus, an organization chaired by then-Rep. Xavier Becerra. Police informed Becerra that the server was the subject of an investigation and requested a copy of it. Authorities considered the false image they received to be interference in a criminal investigation, the senior official said.  Data was also backed up to Dropbox in huge quantities, the official said. Congressional offices are prohibited from using Dropbox, so an unofficial account was used, meaning Awan could have still had access to the data even though he was banned from the congressional network. Important to about Imran Awan, too, this report says, are that his actions on 6 April when he left for the US Capitol Police to find Congressman Wasserman-Schultzs laptop Apple computer, confidential attorney notes, and letters to the US Attorney (that were found on the second floor of the Rayburn building  a place Awan would have had no reason to go because Wasserman Schultz's office is in the Longworth building) shows he is in great fear tooand as US Congressman Louie Gohmert confirmed with his recently stating: If Awan thought he was better off with his crimes documented, that suggests he feared something worse than prison, that this was a matter of life insurance.  As to what and/or whom Imran Awan would fear more than prison, this report details, is, most certainly, the Clinton Crime Family and their infamous Clinton Death Listand who immediately after Awans arrest, dispatched one of their top inner-circle attorneys named Chris Gowan to defend himwith no one bothering to explain (or the US mainstream press investigating) how a defendant who just told a US Federal Judge that he could not afford an attorney because he was millions of dollars in debt, could, 15 minutes later, have one of the most expensive lawyers in America defending him. Congresswoman Wasserman-Shultz, also, this report continues, employed another high-power Clinton Crime Family attorney named William Pittard, to argue that her Apple laptop computer obtained by the US Capitol Police from Imran Awan as his life insurance policy should not be examinedbut who wasnt successful in this childish effort, with Imran Awan even now having for himself a complete copy of this computers hard drive given to him by US Attorneys under that nations discovery laws.  In his knowing that this scandal could very well destroy the Democratic Party forever, this report notes, President Trump, also, knew that in order for US federal prosecutors to discover how wide and deep the Imran Awan spy ring had penetrated the government, and what other secrets they possessed, hinged/pivoted on their securing the testimony of Awans wife Hina Alvibut whom, in late August, Pakistan refused to extradite to the United States.  Immediately following Pakistans refusal to hand over Hina Alvi, this report continues, President Trump, on 30 August, employed his gambit by his notifying the US Congress that he was putting $255 million in military assistance to Pakistan on holdwhile at the same time offering to both Imran Awan and his wife Hina Alvi what some are now describing as a significant immunity deal.  Though Pakistan initially slammed President Trump for being hostile and threatening towards them, this report says, their powerful Inter-Services Intelligence spy agency, nevertheless, agreed to expedite Hina Alvis travel to America later this monthunder the condition that she not be arrested or handcuffed in front of her childrenbut who will have to turn-in her passport when she returns to the United States, with her further agreeing not seek or book any international travel following her appearance in the United States Federal Court.  In order to ensure that Inter-Services Intelligence keeps their side of this agreement to return Hina Alvi to the United States by the end of this month, this report notes, President Trump had his US State Department, yesterday, place Pakistan in a category that lists them as not being fiscally transparent in how they spend American money on their spy agenciesbut that after Hina Alvi reaches the US, will be rescinded, thus allowing Pakistan to receive their $225 million in military assistance currently being blocked.  With the US mainstream propaganda media still blacklisting the information of the, most likely, greatest scandal in US history from being widely known to the America people, and who never report on any scandals involving the Democratic Party, this report continues, their being able to ignore this any longer is coming to a quick endand when compared to the fake news Russian scandal, is not only real, but growing in its ferocity too. This report concludes with SVR intelligence analysts predicting that President Trump will weaponize this scandal in order to totally destroy the Democratic Partywith Trump expected to drag it out for months to its climax during the 2018 US midterm elections that the Democratic Party has only managed to raise $21 million in donations from small donors for, and whose former DNC Chairman, Howard Dean, stunningly just admitted about Americas young voters these people are not Democratsand whose nominal leader, Hillary Clinton, has just released a new book showing that she still doesnt know why she lost to President Trumpbut that any Russian school-child knowing simple mathematics could explain by their showing Clinton the fact that Trump won 2,622 counties in America, while she only won 490and that no matter how much the Democratic Party and their mainstream media sycophant elites dont like to face it, there are simply not enough coastal seats to be won for Democrats to ever win the US Congress again.

" US Explodes After Russian Company Closes CIA Backdoor Embedded In All Microsoft Software http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/index2382.htm A troubling report circulating in the Kremlin today issued by the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MINPROMTORG) states that the United States has exploded with anger and retribution against Russian and United Kingdom based Kaspersky Lab after its experts discovered a backdoor (that bypasses a computers customary security mechanisms) embedded by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) into all Microsoft software productsand who after doing so, these same Kaspersky Lab experts then issued a protective patch (that fixes computer security vulnerabilities) to close this CIA backdoor from ever being opened again.  [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.] According to this report, Kaspersky Labs is one of the worlds largest privately owned cybersecurity companies operating in 200 countries and territories and has 37 offices in 32 countries, and that was founded, in 1997, by Russian military intelligence trained Eugene Kaspersky and his wife Natalyaand who were the first in the world to develop software that monitored computer viruses and placed them in isolated quarantine.  Too numerous to count Western accounts of Kaspersky Labs success in fighting computer viruses, this report continues, have long celebrated this companys global achievementsmost specifically their continuing to thwart US intelligence agencies who believe its their right to spy, not just on every single American, but on the entire world too--and as The Economist, in 2015, described:  Kaspersky Lab has repeatedly impressed skeptics by exposing genuine and serious cyber-security problems. In 2010, for instance, it helped uncover Stuxnet, a computer worm designed to sabotage the Iranian nuclear programme.  On February 16th Kaspersky appeared to repeat this feat, not once, but twice.  First it released a report detailing how a gang it calls Carbanak had hacked the computer systems of banks around the world. It said the gang had stolen several hundred million dollars by moving money to fake accounts and making cash machines dispense their contents.  The same day the firm said it had discovered the Equation Group, apparently part of the NSA, which it said was able to embed spyware in computers that gives it total control over them, even after the hard disk has been erased and the operating system reinstalled. On 12 May of this year, this report details, the international whistle blowing organization WikiLeaks released the latest installment in their Vault7 Series [Warning: it is illegal for persons holding US security clearances to click on this link] that detailed two CIA hacking tools dubbed AfterMidnight and Assassin that target the Microsoft Windows platform providing these US spies with total access to anyones computer or cell phone they so choose.  Upon Kaspersky Lab experts examining these CIA hacking tools, this report explains, they discovered a backdoor embedded in all Microsoft software named PsSetLoadImageNotifyRoutin that sadistically prevents antivirus software from finding computer virus malwareand that Microsoft refused to issue a security patch for with their stunningly stating: Our engineers reviewed the information and determined this does not pose a security threat and we do not plan to address it with a security update.  With Microsoft failing to protect their software from this CIA backdoor, this report continues, Kaspersky Lab created their own fix for it, this past June, which they then placed in their global anti-virus software product called Kaspersky Total Security.  Immediately after Kaspersky Lab released this fix to protect people and their Microsoft software using computer devices from this CIA backdoor, this report further details, the FBI began nighttime raids against this companys employees living in the United States, and then went on a vicious campaign telling private companies in America to no longer use the Kaspersky Total Security anti-virus programme because it was an unacceptable threat to national securitybut with no one in the US offering any proof to substantiate this outrageous claim.  In response to this attack against his company, this report details, Eugene Kaspersky publically offered to provide to the US the source code to his Kaspersky Total Security anti-virus programmed in order to prove that it wasnt a Trojan horse for Russian spieswith his further stating that he was ready to testify in front of Congress, tooanything to show that his company is above board.  Instead of accepting Kasperskys offer, however, and again without offering any evidence, this report says, US Democratic Party Senator Jeanne Shaheen began pushing for a total US federal government-wide ban of anti-virus security software developed by Kaspersky Laband Americas largest electronics retailer, Best Buy, further declaring that it was taking all Kaspersky Lab anti-virus products immediately off of their store shelvesand their even offering to have their Geek Squad remove it from their customers computers toobut with their failing to notify anyone that their Geek Squad tech workers are, also, employed by the FBI to secretly search computers for child pornography.  The red herring (something that distracts attention from the real issue) being used by the US against Kaspersky Lab, this report explains, is its supposed connection to the Russian government and intelligence agencieswhich is an astonishing and outrageous accusation coming from a nation where the CIA has turned every Microsoft Windows PC in the world into spyware and can activate backdoors on demand, including via Windows updateand whose Patriot Act laws give US spy agencies the unlimited power to spy on anyones computers, emails, phone calls, you name it, they want to.  This report concludes by noting that its findings and determinations formed the basis for President Putin just ordering Russia to move away from foreign software for the sake of securityand who stated to all the Russian people: You shouldn't offer IBM products, or foreign software. We won't be able to take it because of too many risks. "	Fake
" Google Backed ANTIFA Attempt To Assassinate President Trump Captured On Video http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/index2372.htm An astonishing Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin today states that President Donald Trump faced near certain death yesterday after the Presidential Motorcade he was riding in was targeted by ANTIFA terroristswith Trump being placed in grave danger due to his Secret Service (SS) protectors placing him in one of their Roadrunner SUVs, instead of his Presidential State Car thats able to withstand the blast that would have occurred should this assassination attack been successfuland that was, also, captured on video. (see below) [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]  According to this report, the SVR is authorized under Federation law to conduct widespread surveillance on any designated terrorist group in the worldand which ANTIFA was so designated, on 12 June 2017, by the State of New Jersey Office of Homeland Security (NJ-OHS) who labeled them as being a domestic terrorist groupand that led to the SVRs shocking discovery earlier this month that these ANTIFA terrorists were being trained in Venezuela.  As it pertains to the attempted assassination of President Trump yesterday, this report explains, SVR surveillance of ANTIFA terrorists operating in the State of Missouri (known as Kansas City ANTIFA) showed large numbers of them being employed by Google Fiberand whose location is in a building located at 908 Broadway, in downtown Kansas City, where, also, ANTIFA terrorists frequently hold meetings.  Yesterday the SVR expressed grave alarm, this report details, when two vehicles owned by Google Fiber left Kansas City and arrived in Springfield (Missouri) at a telecommunication company called the Bass Pro Shop Call Center where they were contracted to do workand that was located in a hidden/secretive position adjacent to President Trumps motorcade route.  Following established protocols when discovering an apparent terrorist attack ready to occur in another nations territory, this report notes, the SVR contacted the Minister of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) whose responsibility it is to notify foreign nationswhich in this case was the United Statesand whose presidential protective forces were able to thwart this attack when, after the ANTIFA bomb carrying vehicle made its attack run, it was quickly disabled by one of Americans viper vehicles. [Note: the term viper as used in this report refers to electronic weapon vehicles able to disable the electronics of its targets.]  In a quick cover-up of this assassination attempt against President Trump, this report says, the mainstream propaganda US news media immediately blacked out this event from being able to be known by the American peoplewith only a bare handful of local media reports even reporting itall of whom lied with their saying that this ANTIFIA attack vehicle was just a car that lost control of its brakesand at occurred at the exact same time President Trumps vehicle was in its sights.  As to why the multi-billion international tech giant Google would want to assassinate President Trump, this report explains, is due to their fears that Trump is preparing to file an anti-trust complaint against them in order to break up their monopolyand that is following the European Unions successful fight against this mammoth evil giant that has, so far, cost Google over $3 billion in fines for its abuse of dominance.  Failing in their attempt to assassinate President Trump by using their ANTIFA funded terrorists, this report continues, Google then went on a rampage against all of their enemiesthe most noted being their threat to cut off funding (estimated at $21 million a year) from the highly influential think tank New America Foundation unless they immediately fired their Google experts who are the most experienced in the world as to how this evil giant runs their monopoly and has corrupted the entire US government structure.  Upon the New American Foundation firing all of their experts knowledgably about this evil giant Google, this report says, one of these researchers fired back a warning to the American people:  What Google did, in attempting to silence my colleagues, was in fact a call to action. It is a call to action for all of us, as citizens, to take back our democracy. We must begin a new era of trust-busting, of public utility regulation, of free and open commerce, and of citizen engagement in our political and commercial spheres.  Our team was attacked by Google, but we will not be silenced. We will continue our research, advocacy, and speaking, because we know that it is working. This is a battle for America, and for free people everywhere. We must win it. We are winning it. Our freedom, and our childrens freedom, depends on it. To how grave this battle of the American people against Google really is, this report concludes, cannot be underestimated as this evil giant is now, also, reported to being pouring billions of its dollars into US collages and universities in order to corrupt them allwith one example being their multi-million dollar support of Dartmouth College lecturer Mark Bray who wrote a terrorist document titled Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbookand when condemned by Dartmouth President Philip Hanlon for his advocating violence, Google ordered hundreds of professors to write a letter calling for Hanlons immediate ousternot the ANTIFA terroist supporting Mark Bray."

" Russia Declares State Of War Now Exists: Orders Masterchain Destruction Of America http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/index2351.htm An apocalyptic sounding new report released in the Kremlin today by the Security Council (SC) affirms that a state of war now exists between the Federation and the United Stateswith all members, including President Putin, authorizing a Masterchain counter attack against the Americans that, if fully successful, could see that nations entire economy destroyed by the end of October.  [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.] According to this report (and as we warned about in our 23 July article New US Law To Remove Trump From Power And Declare War On Russia Will Be Met By Force), President Donald Trump, yesterday, was unable to withstand the Deep State forces arrayed against him, thus causing him to sign a new sanctions regime against Russia that specifically targets all of Russias major industries for destructionand that Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev quickly responded to by grimly stating:  The signing of new sanctions against Russia into law by the US president leads to several consequences. First, any hope of improving our relations with the new US administration is over. Second, the US just declared a full-scale trade war on Russia. Third, the Trump administration demonstrated it is utterly powerless, and in the most humiliating manner transferred executive powers to Congress.  This shifts the alignment of forces in US political circles.  What does this mean for the U.S.? The American establishment completely outplayed Trump. The president is not happy with the new sanctions, but he could not avoid signing the new law.  The purpose of the new sanctions was to put Trump in his place. Their ultimate goal is to remove Trump from power. An incompetent player must be eliminated.  At the same time, the interests of American businesses were almost ignored. Politics rose above the pragmatic approach. Anti-Russian hysteria has turned into a key part of not only foreign (as has been the case many times), but also domestic US policy (this is recent).  The sanctions codified into law will now last for decades, unless some miracle occurs. . With the American Deep State now firmly in control of the United States, this report continues, President Putins orders, issued in late 2016, to prepare for war against the United States have now been acceleratedand none more fearful than Operation Masterchain. Though the propaganda Western media focused exclusively on President Putins bomb shelter preparations, this report details, they failed to inform their peoples that Russia has the most extensive network of bomb shelters to protect against nuclear war the world has ever knownwhile the United States has no protection for its citizens as it doesnt even spend any money on them.  In October 2016 when President Putin ordered these preparations for war, this report says, the Western propaganda media, also, failed to report to their peoples that the Central Bank of the Russian Federation had developed a Masterchain prototype and successfully made its first test transactionsand that is one of the most fearsome weapons of global economic warfare ever invented.  Managed by FinTech under the governance of the Central Bank of Russia, this report explains, the Federation has become the first nation in the world to digitalize its entire domestic and international economy under the blockchain distributed database system (the most important invention since the Internet itself)and that Tunisia became, in January 2016, the first nation in the world to convert its currency into. Though many in the world know about crypto currencies (such as Bitcoin and Tunisias eDinar), this report details, very few understand the staggering implications of its underlying blockchain infrastructurethat is the most secure method of transferring wealth (of all kinds) ever invented, is impervious to hacking and/or spying, and by the day is revolutionizing our entire planet.  With the United States placing its entire economic future under the full control of a vast global military structure, that requires continual conquest of other nations, and has wasted trillions-of-dollars of that nations wealth, this report continues, Russia, instead, invested its economic future in the Blockchain Revolutionthat is called Masterchain and whose crypto currency has been named Gas.  Once fully operational, this report notes, Masterchain and Gas will provide to the world the most secure and secret method of transferring wealth history has ever knownand will be impervious to sanctions, spying and all Western interference.  As nearly all Western economists are warning that the American stock markets are heading for an October 2017 crash of epic proportions, this report says, President Putin has today ordered both Masterchain and Gas to immediately prepare for this global economic crisis offering safety and security to everyone seeking to protect their wealth and investments. And with trillions-of-dollars flowing into Masterchain and Gas, this report explains, the United States will be unable to find any global liquidity to sustain itselfas it is already being crushed by its massive $19.9 trillion debtthat when distributed among its 326.7 million citizens, sees each of them owing their government a staggering $60,192 for each and every one of them.  Russia, however, this report continues, has never matched the warmongers in America and has kept defense spending at a fraction of what the US spendsthus allowing the Federation to have a miniscule national debt of only $157.9 billionthat can be paid off instantly from Russias $412 billion of savingsand whose 143 million citizens owe nothingand all of whom live in a nation twice the size of the United States having a total national wealth of $75 trillion.  With the Deep State now firmly in control of the US Congress, this report warns, their bloodlust shows no signs of abating either as they are now, also, preparing several defense bills that would require their Department of Defense to violate the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty with Russia through the development of medium-range missiles banned under the accordwith one of their top Democratic Party lawmakers, US Senator Ben Cardin, triumphantly declaring We make the laws, not the President of the United States.  And as President Trump just hours ago warned that relations between the US and Russia are at an all-time and very dangerous low, and his adding that the American people should blame the US Congress for this turn of events, this report concludes, his sudden announcement that he is going into seclusion for 17 days (beginning Friday) has raised further alarms among Security Council members wondering who exactly is now in control of the United States.

According to police statements, Jessop was sorting through the stores discount DVD bin when she discovered a lifeless newborn buried in the middle of the bin. On-scene witnesses say that several customers made it over to the area after hearing Jessop scream and call for help. Jessop recalled seeing a small foot as she dug to the bottom of the DVD pile. Initially she assumed that someone had placed a doll within the pile. It wasnt until she grabbed the foot and pulled the body from the pile of DVDs that she realized it was not a doll, but the body of a lifeless newborn girl.  Local police and paramedics confirmed that the child had been dead for approximately 48 hours and was estimated to be around two months old. Upon reviewing security footage, police estimated that the child was placed in the DVD bin by the young girls mother on Friday. The security footage provided by Walmart Loss Prevention Department has yet to be released to the public. However, investigating officers believe the newborns mother to be Luciana Garcia, a 27-year-old Roy County resident.

This trip was an absolute success, and the President did an amazing job. World leaders appreciated his presence, and they all honored the President. He enjoyed great respect, and came back with a few important deals. But, President Trump came back with something else. Its the covfefe mystery. For those who dont know it, covfefe means I will stand up. Liberals thought that President Trump was dream texting, but they are too ignorant to understand the meaning of his tweet.

" Candy Flavored Meth For Kids Approved By FDA, Despite Side Effects Like Heart Attacks http://viralactions.com/candy-flavored-meth-for-kids-approved-by-fda-despite-side-effects-like-heart-attacks/ Now its even easier (and tastier) for children to become addicted to drugs.  The FDA approved candy-flavored amphetamine to be used to treat children six or older that have been diagnosed with ADHD. The label itself says that the drug has a high potential for abuse and dependence, which is not something most parents want their children to be consuming daily.  Active ingredients in the drug itself make it addicting, but the sweet, candy-flavored gummies only serve to keep kids wanting more. Many healthcare professionals are concerned about possible addiction-forming that could follow the children into adulthood, but that hasnt stopped Neos Therapeutics from producing the drug.  The Dallas-based pharmaceutical company is pushing forward with Adzenys XR-ODT, the name give to this new form of meth. The CEO of the company, Vipin Garg, launching now at full speedpun intendedin an effort to get ahead of back-to-school season. Neos Therapeutics has shown no shame in this new endeavor, and, instead, has bragged about their 125 sales representatives who have been making appointments with physicians to get the drug out on the market.  While lawmakers are attempting to ban cannabis edibles that resemble sweet treats, the government is continuing to push these addicting gummy drugs because it can actually be controlled and turn out a profit.  Though lawmakers are ignoring the emergence of this dangerous substance, citizens cannot ignore the concerning fact that recreational use of medications like Adderall have increased in adults by 67 percent. To top it all off, the side effects of these drugs range from mild to sudden death, which has apparently happened in adults. Dr. Carl Hart, a professor of psychology and psychiatry at Columbia University, said:  The public remains almost entirely ignorant of the fact that methamphetamine produces nearly identical effects to those produced by the popular ADHD medication d-amphetamine (dextroamphetamine). You probably know it as Adderall.  Other side effects include fever, hair loss, hallucinations, psychotic episodes, strokes, and dangerously high blood pressure, meaning that there are no benefits for children in taking this drug over Adderall, which may have the same active ingredients but at least it doesnt taste like candy.  Despite the evidence that these drugs can kill and are being offered to children, the FDA has said that they are safe and effective in treating ADHD and narcolepsy."	Fake

" PLANET X IS REAL AND IT FORMED IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM, NEW STUDY http://www.disclose.tv/news/planet_x_is_real_and_it_formed_in_our_solar_system_new_study/140320 Konstantin Batygin and Mike Brown, two astronomers, published in 2016 what they said was the first evidence of there being another planet in the Solar System with the name of Planet 9.  The planet was thought to be orbiting at some distance from the Sun and since then more studies have been made with the aim of addressing the question everyone wanted to know, where Planet X, also known as Planet 9, actually came from.  WAS PLANET 9 AN EXOPLANET EARLY IN THE HISTORY OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM?  Some of the studies have revealed that the planet might have moved to the Solar Systems edge when it formed closer to the Sun.  Other people have said that it could be an exoplanet that was in the history of the Solar System early.  However, two astronomers have now cast doubts on the latter and they have suggested that Planet 9 could have formed a lot closer to the Sun and then migrated out throughout history.  The study by the two former astronomers was called Was Planet 9 Captured in the Suns Natal Star-Forming Region and it was published in the Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. Dr Richard Parker from the University of Sheffield Department of Physics and Astronomy made simulations that cast doubt on the capture scenario.  The existence of Planet 9 had first been suggested back in 2014 by Scott S. Sheppard and Chad Trujillo and they based their suggestions on behavior that was unusual of certain populations of extreme Trans-Neptunian Objects.  They conducted studies over years and constraints had gradually been placed on the parameters of the planet.  PLANET 9 COULD BE TEN TIMES LARGER THAN EARTH  Planet 9 is thought to be ten times as big as Earth and around two to four times its size.  It is thought that it has an elliptical orbit around the Sun and the average distance is about 700 AU, and it ranges from 200 AU at perihelion to about 1200 AU at aphelion. The scientists said that Planet 9 would take between 10,000 and 20,000 years for it to complete one single orbit of the Sun.  Due to this, it is not thought that Planet 9 will have formed in its current location.  This is one of the reasons why astronomers have argued that it was formed close to the Sun or it was captured out of another star system many billions of years ago.  Dr. Parker said that it is known that planetary systems do form same time that the stars do and young stars are typically found in groups, with interactions between the stellar siblings are something that is common.  The environment was the stars form will directly affect the planetary systems much like our own and usually are so dense in a population that the stars are able to capture other stars and in some cases planets.  ODDS OF PLANET 9 BEING CAPTURED IS LOW The team undertook numerous simulations of the Solar System for their study when in the early phase of formation.  The interactions with the other star systems along with their planets were common during this period and the team of researchers found that despite the conditions being optimized for capturing planets that were free-floating, the odds that Planet 9 had been captured were low.  The simulations revealed that the orbit of Planet 9 around 5 to 10 planets from the 10,000 would have been captured during the Solar System being young.  This meant that the chances of Planet 9 being kicked out of a different solar system, and then being captured by the Sun, were only around 1 out of 1,200 or 2,000.  If Planet 9 had not been captured then there is just one possibility remaining, that it was formed nearer to the Sun and then it made its way beyond Neptunes orbit and went on to reach distances that had been occupied by Kuiper Belt Objects that were the most extreme. The search for the mysterious and somewhat elusive planet is continuing and research that puts additional constraints on the characteristics have been found to be very useful.  Only by ruling out the many different scenarios by which the planet may have formed can the researchers ask new questions about the evolution and the history of the Solar System.  These are questions such as from when did the planets that we know come from and did migration play a part or did they form in their current orbit?"	Fake
" ALL FOUND MURDERED! DOCTORS WHO DISCOVERED CANCER ENZYMES IN VACCINES http://www.disclose.tv/news/all_found_murdered_doctors_who_discovered_cancer_enzymes_in_vaccines/139084 A number of holistic doctors in Florida, over 60 of them within one year, who have been found, killed or dead all have one common denominator.  They had all found out that an enzyme protein was cancer causing and the protein with the name of Nagalese had been added to vaccines that had been given to humans and this is something that has been happening on a global scale. DOCTORS WERE SAID TO BE GETTING READY TO REVEAL FINDINGS Nagalese is said to be an enzyme that stops vitamin D from being produced in the body and so stops the natural ability of the body to kill off any cancer cells.  It is also a protein that is created by cancer cells and can be found in high concentrations in children with autism.  It was revealed that it has been put into vaccines.  Nagalese affects the immune system as it disables it and it has also been known to be the cause behind Type 2 diabetes.  It was said that the doctors who discovered this were not being killed because they had found a cancer cure or were treating autism successfully, but they were killed because they had researched and found evidence that vaccines that had been injected into children had been causing cancer and autism crisis.  The doctors who had researched and who had been collaborating in Florida were said to have been getting ready to reveal their findings to the public.  VIDEO CLIP EMERGED FOLLOWING SHOW BEING TAKEN DOWN  A 19-minute video clip has been put online with a lot of important information being said during the first 10 minutes of the video.  The speaker in the video is Dr Ted Broer and he breaks the information about Nagalese in the video and he goes on to explain the findings of the doctors.  Broer had broken into The Hagmann & Hagmann Report and it took an hour to get him on air as the show, which typically lasts three hours, had been taken down and all the lines they had tried to use kept on being disconnected, then servers were brought down.  An hour later they connected with Dr. Broer and one of the first things he was heard saying was that he was not suicidal.  It was said that he had been frightened that he would be taken out Hastings style before getting the opportunity to say what he had to say publicly.  The short clip is him telling the story. It was alleged that on three different dates in one month two doctors died on the very same day, which means six doctors in total who died in pairs over three different days.  Many skeptics rolled their eyes at the first few deaths believing it to be no more than coincidence that they had all been doctors.  There were many deaths that were unsolved murders, more were alleged to be suicides and many of the deaths are under investigation.  The majority of the doctors had been holistic and all them were said to have cared very passionately and deeply about health. "	Fake

You see, while this attack was clearly intended to silence Blackman by either killing him or making him too afraid to speak, he left a journal behind.  In case something happens to me, this is a record of what I observed while working in the Obama household are the very first words in the 163-page binder of loose-leaf paper that serves as Blackmans journal.  A full copy has not yet been released, but Breitbart News has the following:  January 23, 2017: Mr. Obama is increasingly paranoid. This afternoon, he ordered Mathilda to shred more than 2,000 pages of documents and to run magnets over multiple hard drives. I suspect this has something to do with the election project I overheard details of last week.  I dont know how much longer I can work here. I cant look my children in the eyes knowing that I participated in a plot to overthrow the duly-elected President, however indirectly.  Blackman tendered his resignation two days later. The FBI reportedly has copies of the journal, which they are viewing with a great degree of interest.  Obama may have added another body to the pile, but Blackmans journal could finally be responsible for taking him down.  Thank you for your sacrifice, sir."	Fake
" Procter & Gamble Release One Of The Most Racist Commercials Ever Attacking White People Lets Boycott http://anews-24.com/2017/08/02/procter-gamble-release-one-of-the-most-racist-commercials-ever-attacking-white-people-lets-boycott/ In an outrageous attempt to sell more soap and household cleaning products to the American-American community, Procter & Gamble decided to produce a commercial attacking white Americans and reinforcing racial biases against blacks. The commercial, called The Talk, features a series of black parents telling their children how white people are racist and the system is designed to work against them.  The commercial is part of the companys controversial new ad campaign called, My Black is Beautiful which uses the hashtag #TalkAboutBias.  These real-life conversations about conscious and unconscious bias are too common in homes across the country and weigh heavily on parents and children of many different backgrounds, one Procter & Gamble official said. We take seriously the opportunity to spark dialogue on what we all can do to put an end to the harmful effects of bias, and motivate true change.  The campaign has quickly sparked outrage on social media, with many arguing that the company is using racism to sell products.  This whole commercial from Procter & Gamble  is nothing more than a marketing ploy to try to get black women on the Internet  to buy their products. Its a marketing campaign to get people to come purchase things. Its nothing else. Its not some kind of PSA. Its not an altruistic thing. Its all about money and thats it, Anthony Brian Logan said.

" Wikileaks Massive Exposure: Here Are 6 Republicans Who Took Bribes from Clinton to 'Destroy Trump' http://americannews.com/24812-2/ Hillary Clinton is still whining about her humiliating loss to President Donald Trump in last years election. She plans to take him down and her plan involves some powerful Republicans. Wikileaks named Paul Ryan, Carly Fiorina, John Kasich, Jeb Bush, Lindsey Graham, and John McCain as Republicans who were paid off by Clinton to ensure that Donald Trump lost the election, or undermine him if he won as reported by Conservative Daily Post. Her evil plot was revealed in an email sent last July from Clintons campaign manager John Podesta to top aide Huma Abedin.Podesta detailed how the funds were being redirected from Clintons campaign to the Super PACs of Carly Fiorina, John Kasich, and Jeb Bush. JB, CF, and JK PACS will be noticeably silent for the rest of the campaign. The email continued, Each will receive a significant allowance from advertising budget. HRC is in the loop and has talked to all three personally. Eyes only. As revealed in other emails, several members of the Republican Party were bought off in order to push the Clinton agenda forward. Only one day before Speaker of the House Paul Ryan retracted Donald Trumps invitation to speak at an event in Wisconsin, an email was sent out that could be to blame. It read, He is on board, will retract the invitation to speak. Eyes only. Other Clinton emails imply that money is being moved to Republican elected officials in the House and Senate. For example, right after John McCain attacked President Trump by publicly criticizing him, FEC records show that two large donations from PACS and private sources went to the senator immediately after."

An FBI source told reporters that Imran Awan, Wasserman Schultzs IT administrator made desperate attempts to get the hard drives back, but to no avail. Another anonymous source within Congress said the FBI was investigating serious, potentially illegal, violations on the House IT network by Awan and three of his relatives.  The FBI also reportedly collected evidence that Awan and his family may have been sending millions of dollars of House Democrats funds to Pakistan. Of course, the investigation has been criticized by liberals as being Islamophobic.  But suspicions continue to grow as staffers found the Awans computers were being used to transfer information to off-site servers. His access to House documents has since been blocked and the brothers stepmother independently filed a lawsuit accusing them of wiretapping and threatening her.

The ranch, just a few hundred miles north of anything in Wyoming, was also seized along with a fleet of automobiles, recreational vehicles and other property now considered the spoils of the drug trade.  The bust itself yielded more than $6 million in finished drugs alone, never mind the plants and raw product waiting for packaging. All in all, Senator Lindsay is looking at 70 years behind bars on the opium alone. He was taken into custody at his office in Washington DC and has since been booked and released on $10 million bail.  Lindsays office isnt commenting on the ordeal but New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has already called for his removal and a special election as soon as possible.

" Repeat Sex Offender Arrested Dressed As Woman In Trans-Friendly Restroom http://civictribune.com/repeat-sex-offender-arrested-dressed-woman-trans-friendly-restroom/ James Moorles now prefers to go by Jamie, and identifies as a woman. The 56 year old Jamie has also been an avid supporter of trans-inclusive bathroom rights, and was recently a key figure in forcing several businesses to adopt the policy within their lavatories. Activist groups lauded Jamies efforts at the time as both courageous and inspirational.  Others have been more cynical about Jamies intentions, because theres just one problem: James Moorles has been on the Hanna, Wyoming sex offender registry since 2005. He has been arrested two times for lewd and lascivious acts with females under the age of 10, and spent a 2 year stint in a medium security prison.  Jamie Moorles dresses as a woman full time, and claims to have started hormone treatments within the last few months. During a recent interview with the local Hanna, Wyoming paper, Moorles told reporters that she has been cured of the affliction which caused her to commit her former crimes, and now as a trans woman is unable to pose a threat to children.  I just dont have those kinds of filthy thoughts anymore Jamie told reporters at the time Ive found out who I really am, and thats a woman. You cant stop me from using the restroom of my gender identity she continued, Its the law now, I made sure of that.  I spoke with the arresting officer for one of the two initial child abuse reports. Detective William Simmons of the Hanna, Wyoming Police Department was the first to respond to Moorles victims after one of the girls informed her parents of the abuse. Witnessing firsthand the the havoc Moorles wreaked on the innocent girls lives, hes been unenthusiastic about Jamies rehabilitation, and shift in gender identity.  I have had no doubt in my mind that Mr. Moorles would re-offend. It was only a matter of time. This facade was merely a ploy used as an avenue to continue his abuse of children. I do not believe his transgenderism is sincere.  Jamie Moorles is now being held in the mens complex of the Hannah, Wyoming County jail, despite protestsand is awaiting trial for a recent assault in, you guessed it, a public restroom. The victims name has not been released due to the fact that she is a minor, and currently no additional details of the attack have been released, pending trial.  Local LGBTQ activists and former friends of Jamie have been refusing to speak with reporters about the incident.  Detective Simmons had this final thought to add If attacks like this continue, the trans community could have a very difficult time gaining the acceptance in public restrooms that they seem to want. People are going to hear about this, and theyre going to be mad, and that anger will surely lead to distrust."	Fake

On Wednesday the Bishop Of Rome addressed 11,000 ticketed guests on the South Lawn of the White House, during which he pontificated on the dire importance of exhibiting religious tolerance. During his hour-long speech, a smiling Pope Francis was quoted telling the White House guests that the Koran, and the spiritual teachings contained therein, are just as valid as the Holy Bible, and should therefore be respected as such.  Jesus Christ, Jehovah, Allah. These are all names employed to describe an entity that is distinctly the same across the world. For centuries, blood has been needlessly shed because of the desire to segregate our faiths. This, however, should be the very concept which unites us as people, as nations, and as a world bound by faith. Together, we can bring about an unprecedented age of peace, all we need to achieve such a state is respect each others beliefs, for we are all children of God regardless of the name we choose to address him by. We can accomplish miraculous things in the world by merging our faiths, and the time for such a movement is now. No longer shall we slaughter our neighbors over differences in reference to their God.  The pontiff drew harsh criticism last December after photos of the 78-year-old Catholic leader was released depicting Pope Francis kissing a Koran. The Muslim Holy Book was given to Francis during a meeting with Muslim leaders after a lengthy Muslim prayer held at the Vatican.  St. John Paul II has courted several controversies since being elected as Pope Benedicto XVIs replacement in 2013. Francis has gone on record to say that homosexuals are not to be judged, Proselytism is a fallacy and has endorsed the usage of contraceptive by Catholics.  The Vatican will meet again with Muslim leaders in late October where they plan to talk about further steps that can be taken to spread understanding and awareness of the Islamic religion."	Fake
" Iowas Parental Fitness Initiative Panned By Residents http://civictribune.com/iowas-parental-fitness-initiative-panned-by-residents/ Judy Strauss is the Executive Director and coordinator of the Fit Parenthood Initiative, based out of Cedar Springs, Iowa. For the past two years Judy has made it her primary goal to mandate a law requiring all parents of children under the ages of 16 years old to be physically fit. Backed by several prominent law makers, she is close to seeing her dream finalized when Iowa Legislature votes on parental fitness tests mandatory for couples and individuals looking to have a child.Civic Tribune spoke with Mrs. Strauss on Monday and inquired her motivation and what she eventually hopes to achieve with this new law. She had the following to say:  People dont seem to understand that parenthood is a privilege, not a right. The numbers of children being born into homes where parents are inadequate is absolutely staggering. In many cases, we have unhealthy people who simply run rampant, producing several children that they are unable to care for on any level.  Foster care and adoption services absorb some of these costs but the overall damage inflicted by these unfortunate couplings is long-lasting and tangible. There has been several instances where adoptive parents do their best to raise a child in the correct manner, but the childs genetic programming is too strong to ignore, regardless of efforts and investments of the adopter. Its clearly nature over nurture in a lot of cases. These heartbreaking scenarios happens every day. We are simply trying to control the number of children born to adults who are biologically hardwired for failure, disease and addiction.  The Bill has caused quite a stir in the Midwestern region and even gained country-wide notoriety after being parodied on Saturday Night Live. In addition to being slammed by several local politicians, the proposal is unwelcome by the majority of residents.  The program provides no-cost pregnancy termination services for those who have failed their parental adequacy tests. If a person refuses the termination, they may be forcibly arrested and detained until they comply with the protocol."	Fake
" Married Christians Divorcing In Protest Of Gay Marriage http://civictribune.com/married-christians-divorcing-protest-gay-marriage/ Christian couples, some who have been married for over 20 years, are getting divorced in droves after the Supreme Courts decision to all gays to be married. This is said to be in protest to a government that does not respect their religious rights, and a minority that has encroached on one of their time honored traditions. Since the historic day in which gay couples could wed nation wide, thousands of Christian couples are filing for divorce.  Mary Lambert and her husband Jay were among the first to arrive at the courthouse in Topeka Kansas to file for divorce. Despite having been married for over 14 years, they chose to call it quits to avoid affiliation with a government that no longer respects their values. I love my husband very much, but above all, I love my god, Jesus Christ. This is why we are moving forward in defiance of the Supreme Court ruling. If our government chooses to celebrate sin and spit on one of the most righteous ceremonies within our faith, then they are on their own. Marriage is about so much more than love. A family cannot grow together if they have no relationship with Christ. Anything else is just a sad parody. Its unfortunate that even our president has made the choice to stoop so low and pander to Satans agenda  Adam Cyrus is the founder of Christ in Family Services which provides bible-based counseling to married Christian couples throughout Topeka Kansas. Cyrus says he supports the wave of high-principled duos seeking divorce as an act of protest. We are symbolically divorcing a government which no longer honors our culture and values. We have no desire to benefit from a system which characterizes us as the enemy and enables and rewards sin under the guise of holy matrimony. If they wish to reward and empower those who desire to make a mockery of our faith, and misrepresent our religion, then we intend to remove ourselves altogether from this bureaucracy so that we may practice our faith in accordance to our beliefs."

" The Clinton Body Count Continues...New Evidences Revealed http://americannews.com/24759-2/ Most Conservatives know that the Clintons pose a real threat to America and their body count continues to rise. They have killed more people than the Swine Flu and Ebola combined. Of course everybody wants to ask the obvious question about Hillary Clintons IT guy, Why would a server guy plead the 5th?! One answer, he did it to save his life. This man is a liability because he may know more than anyone about the killings.Sorcha Faal believes that its best to err on the side of caution, but not doing so will put you in the dog pound with the Mafia, otherwise known as the Clinton Foundation:In what a new Foreign Intelligence Service(SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin today calls a master incestuous maneuver, the Bush Crime Family has rushed to the side of Hillary Clinton afrter a top United Nations official set to testify her in a US District Court yesterday was found dead by FBI agents who were set to deliver him before a Grand Jury. (Note: some words and phrases appearing in this report are English language approximations of Russian words and phrases having no exact counterpart.) According to this report, former UN Presiden John Ashe was scheduled to terstify against Hillary Clinton yesterday in a New York City US District Court, but when FBI agents arrived at his Dobbs Ferry, New York, mansion he was found dead of what current UN President Mogens Lykketoft said was a heart attack-but that SVR intelligence analysts say in this report is impossible to determine prior to an autopsy being performed and medical tests conducted. This is reminiscent of the time that Ron Brown went on an assignment for the Clintons and his plane just so happened to crash into a mountain.CNN reported at the time that Browns hand was forced:A former business partner of the late Commerce Secretary Ron Brown testified in U.S. District Court Monday that Brown had told her President and Mrs. Clinton supported at White House plan to sell seats on international trade missions to raise campaign contributions. Nolanda Hill, who is under federal indictment for fraudulent business practices, claimed Brown was angered when White House political operatives forced him to provide seats on trade missions as a fund-raising device.The Clintons will do anything for money. Dont forget they sold secrets to the Chinese for campaign contributions. This Chinese billionaire has avoided the Clintons death wish so far. Faal continues:Along with UN President Ashe and Chinese billionaire Seng being indicted for being a part of this massive bribery scheme to enrich the Clinton's and fuel Hillary's presidential run, this report notes, Francis Lorenzo, the ambassador to the UN for the Dominican Republic, and the top two executives for the Global Sustainability Foundation(GSF), Sheri Yan and Heidi Hon Piao, were, also, changed, all of whom had reached plea deals in exchange for their testimony against the Clinton's and Seng-has had, likewise, UN President Ashe done just prior to his death. Grimly to note too, this report continues, is that a powerful indicator that UN President Ashe was being targeted for death revealed itself this past January(2016) when Chinese billionare Seng (currently under house arrest in his New York City penthouse) suddenly dropped his bid for a speedy trial-and which SVR analysts in this reoprt attribute to his being given assurances/guarantees by the Clinton's that once Hillary gained the US presidency he would pardoned. Make no mistake, Hillary enjoys the killings. The Clintons are dangerous and they will sell America down the river with no remorse."	Fake

The Clinton family, including extended relatives and members of the Rodham clan, have been filing  into Little Rock all week where Bill is reportedly bedridden at the residence attached to his presidential library. From an article in The Political Insider, authors Darwin Porter and Danforth Prince share the big reveal: In their new book, Bill & Hillary: So This is That Thing Called Love, the authors interview Clinton insiders who claim that  Bill slept with so many women that Hillary Clinton has repeatedly forced him to get an HIV test from the doctor. This is because the former President favored unprotected sex. And while the first tests came back negative, HIV and AIDS might explain an ongoing mystery. Over the years, both Clintons have kept their medical records a secret. Clinton has explained his rapidly changing appearance to his heart surgery and new diet  but he has looked increasingly thin and weak at Hillary campaign rallies. Being someone who has had first hand experience watching a family member die from AIDS, this writer can testify that Bill Clinton  looks like he is very close to entering the final stages and is holding on for dear life! Hillary appears to be keeping the  family physician close at hand even if for no other reason than the old grim reaper may be stalking her too! The fact that theyre booking rooms and sticking around most likely means theyre expecting to have to stay for a funeral. The  Clintons have said that they would refuse any state burial or national ceremony if anything were to happen to them during the  Trump administration as they are afraid of what he may say during the service. According to a Clinton spokesman: Donald Trump is mean and vindictive. If something were to happen to one of the Clintons, he could demand to speak at a national  service and who knows what kind of disrespect would come out of his childish mouth. If the rumors are true, a service would be held at the Arkansas State House after Clinton spends two days lying in state in the arboretum at his library. The Trump family would not be invited.  This is a developing story that will be updated."	Fake

According to the Philadelphia Police Department, the partially devoured corpse of his wife was lying next to him when he was rescued after  being stuck for three days in an elevator. Mr Franklin immediately confessed that he had reluctantly killed her and eaten almost 12 lbs of her flesh, saying it was necessary to his  own survival. Philadelphia Police Deputy Commissioner Richard Ross, says the accused clearly felt guilty about his crime. Mr Franklin and his wife, Janet Willis, were coming back from the restaurant when they took an express elevator to reach their apartment on  the 42nd floor. On their way up, the elevator unexpectedly stopped, and the couple was stranded. Mr Franklin says he hit the alarm and waited, but nothing happened. He investigated his surroundings, but there was no warning text and no  elevator emergency phone in the 6-by-6 box. Since they didnt have their cell phones with them, the couple had no way of reaching the outside world. Hours went by and no one came. Starting to get desperate, the 300-lb man tried to pry the door open, planning to climb down the elevator  shaft like Bruce Willis in Die Hard. Instead, he was met with a solid concrete wall with the number 13 stenciled on it. Being in an express elevator, there was no opening for the floors that werent served, and Mr. Franklin found himself facing 34 floors of  solid concrete shaft. The couple could do nothing but stand there for the rest of the afternoon. And into the night. And then overnight. Then all day the next day. After about 48 hours, Mr Franklin says he was suffering from severe dehydration and began fearing for his life. According to his lawyer, Darrel Hunter, Bruce Franklin had no other choice than to kill his wife and ingest her flesh and blood if he wanted to survive. Mr Hunter says his client is in fact a victim and that Ms Willis death was caused by the negligence of the residential buildings security staff. Despite his lawyers claims, Mr Franklin now faces a total of 14 charges, including second degree murder and cannibalism. He could face up  to 75 years in prison."	Fake

" Donald Trump Signs Executive Order Allowing The Hunting Of Bald Eagles https://archive.is/2yRCq#selection-3293.0-3293.70 WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP)  Today President Donald Trump made what could very well prove to be the most controversial move of his presidency by signing Executive Order 14841, which allows the hunting of bald eagles. Speaking at a White House Press Conference today, Trump explained his decision for making the hunting of the bald eagle legal. Theres nothing more American and more of a symbol of freedom, than having the freedom to hunt and kill a bald eagle, Trump told reporters. This will allow Americans to take advantage of their Second Amendment rights in the most Patriotic way possible. Plus the taste is absolutely tremendous, a great bird, the best tasting bird. I ate one the last time I was in China, absolutely delicious. The bald eagle is both the national bird and national animal of the United States of America. The bald eagle appears on its seal. The founders of the United States were fond of comparing their new republic with the Roman Republic, in which eagle imagery (usually involving the golden eagle) was prominent. On June 20, 1782, the Continental Congress adopted the design for the Great Seal of the United States depicting a bald eagle grasping 13 arrows and an olive branch with its talons. The bald eagle appears on most official seals of the U.S. government, including the presidential seal, the presidential flag, and in the logos of many U.S. federal agencies. In 1940 a Federal law was passed that provides protection of the bald eagle by prohibiting the take, possession, sale, purchase, barter, offer to sell, purchase or barter, transport, export or import, of any bald eagle, alive or dead, including any part, nest or egg. Trumps Executive Order will override this law, legalizing the hunting and killing of the bird, allowing the hunter to do with the bald eagle as he or she sees fit. Trump spoke further to reporters about his decision to allow the hunting of bald eagles. Honestly, I wish the bald eagle had not been chosen as the representative of our country. He is a bird of bad moral character, very bad. He does not get his living honestly probably is an illegal too. And because of this we should change the symbol of America, the American Seal, to something more appropriate, something greater, and I can only think of one thing; Trump Towers. They stand for freedom in this country and the potential that every good Christian, God-fearing American has in this country. This Executive Order does not come as a surprise to most environmental activists. 38-year-old Paul Horner, with the Washington State Department of Ecology, says he disagrees with everything Trump has done since taking office when it comes to protecting the environment. Trump put a man in charge of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) who doesnt believe in climate change. Hes lifting regulations on every evil out there imaginable; allowing coal dumping in our waters, attempting to rid us of every law that protects the environment, laws which have been put in place over the last hundred years to keep us alive so greed like this cant happen, Horner said Trump is doing everything possible to get rich off this, to polluting the air we breathe to putting GMOs in all the food that we eat, Horner said. Its only a matter of time before Trump Towers is under water and were all wearing oxygen masks, something that hell profit off of through insurance and hell probably make the oxygen masks called Trump Fun Masks or something. Its absolutely disgusting and the public needs to wake up to what this greedy as*hole is doing to our environment and the planet Earth. Trump quickly took to Twitter to respond to those who oppose of his Executive Order that allows the hunting of bald eagles. There is NOTHING more PATRIOTIC than killing a bald eagle, the symbol of AMERICA! Executive Order 14841 will be GREAT, THE BEST THING EVER! Once a common sight in much of the continent, the bald eagle was severely affected in the mid-20th century by a variety of factors, among them the thinning of egg shells attributed to use of the pesticide DDT. Bald eagles, like many birds of prey, were especially affected by DDT due to biomagnification. DDT itself was not lethal to the adult bird, but it interfered with the birds calcium metabolism, making the bird either sterile or unable to lay healthy eggs. The species was first protected in the U.S. and Canada by the 1918 Migratory Bird Treaty, later extended to all of North America. The Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, approved by the U.S. Congress in 1940, protected the bald eagle and the golden eagle, prohibiting commercial trapping and killing of the birds. The bald eagle was declared an endangered species in the U.S. in 1967, and amendments to the 1940 act between 1962 and 1972 further restricted commercial uses and increased penalties for violators. Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters details of the bald eagle hunting licenses that will be made available to the public on June 1st, 2017. These hunting licenses for the bald eagle will be made available to only those Americans who truly love this country. They must be able to prove that that they are American, and not illegal anchor babies or Muslims. Also, these licenses are free for children under the age of twelve. If youre not a good, Christian American, dont even think of getting one of these licenses. These licenses stand for freedom and are not to be abused or used by those who hate America. The Trump administration said it has plans to completely defund the EPA by the end of the year, which has already devastated the great barrier reef, saying that this will allow more funds available for defense. Tom Downey, political activist, told reporters he believes what Trump is doing is wrong, but can be stopped. From citizens swarming airports and launching legal challenges to block Trumps travel ban, to the flooding of town halls, offices and voicemails of Congress across the country to defeat the disastrous roll back of our healthcare rights, on many fronts right now massive citizen mobilization is winning! The Trump Administration calls Climate Change a hoax and a waste! But when we show up together we have tremendous power, lets never forget it! Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, spoke to reporters about Trumps decision to legalize the hunting of bald eagles in this country. Everything Trump stands for is backwards. His appointment of racist Steve Bannon, the way he unites hate for the Muslim people in this country, his support of white power organizations. He appointed a cabinet full of billionaires and millionaires to standup for the lower and middle class. The person he puts in charge of the EPA denies climate change. The person he put in charge of education doesnt believe in public education. The American people should not accept this and Saturday Night Live makes fun of him the best way they know how. The children of this country deserve a leader who will build a successful future for them and can take a joke and not attempt to stop freedom of speech. Bradley said. Also, I just want to say a big thanks to everyone that has supported our cause that gives brand new socks to the homeless. Please, donate what you can, every bit helps so much. Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, a mascot for a Christian organization that travels around the country educating children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, told CNN that he believes what Trump is doing is the right thing. This is a great first step in the war against masturbation in this great Christian nation of ours! The bald eagle is an extremely sexy looking bird and only brings out deviant behavior in the Atheists, Devil Worshippers, non-normals and the heathens of this country. Way to go Donald Trump, you are legendary! Praise! The Trump Administration has setup a hotline for those wishing to voice any concerns or comments over the new bald eagle hunting licenses that will be made available next month. That hotlines phone number is (785) 273-0329."	Fake
" What Donald Trump Did For 200 Marines Shows Who He Really Is http://americannews.com/what-donald-trump-did-for-200-marines-shows-who-he-really-is/ Throughout his campaign, Donald Trump has demonstrated his unwavering support for our troops. This is something that has been missing from the White House for some time now. Recently, Hannity gave a report about Trump that speaks louder than any of his statements could. During the war, Trump reportedly helped 200 stranded Marines who didnt have a flight home to Florida. Cpl. Ryan Stickney claims that after his unit spent six months in Saudi Arabia, it went to Camp Lejeune in North Carolina before heading home to Miami. Due to a logistics failure, the troops ended up stranded. The way the story was told to us was that Mr. Trump found out about it and sent the airline down to take care of us, Stickney commented. And thats all we knewI remember asking Who is Donald Trump? I truly didnt know anything about him. This is the same person that the media likes to portray as selfish. It may not seem like much to most people, but it was very important to a bunch of jar heads and more importantly their families waiting for them on the hot tarmac, he continued. I have not seen a Clinton or Sanders plane, or anything else for that matter, sent to support the troops. What do you think of Trump? Is he clearly a man of his word?"	Fake
" Donald Trump Says The Earth Is Flat http://archive.is/ZG5ct#selection-3437.0-3437.35 Baltimore, MD (AP)  Speaking to reporters in Baltimore on Monday, following the 138th conference for the National Guard Association of the United States, the Republican Partys presidential nominee revealed that he is a member of a growing population known generally as flat earth truthers. I fly a lot, and I mean a lot. No one flies more than me. Listen, I own a jet. I own a 757, beautiful plane, its the best plane! If the world were round, believe me, I would know! The comments came in response to a question from AP reporter, Charles Darr, regarding the future role of the National Guard, as private companies proliferate space travel. Mr. Trump, if elected, are you willing to increase taxes in order to meet the growing budget demands of the National Guard, as existential threats from our enemies grow along with the advancement of space travel technology? Darr asked. The presidential hopeful replied that such a future is nonsense, adding that the round earth people, and you know who they are, these people have an agenda.After declaring that the world is flat, Mr. Trump, as he has done before, again cited the Internet as his primary source of information. There are people out there, many people, and I mean missile experts, sailors, you name it, folks, and this is what theyre saying. Its all on the Internet, its there. The flat earth conspiracy theory, like most conspiracy theories, is propagated primarily via the Internet. Internet forums and YouTube channels are dedicated to enlightening the vast majority who, as truthers explain, naively buy into the globe earth theory that has been sold to them since birth. One piece of evidence that flat earth truthers present as proof that there is a global conspiracy against them, is the emblem used by the United Nations, implying that the intergovernmental organization is part of the conspiracy. In it, the planet is displayed as a flat earth, with the northern pole at the center, and southern hemisphere continents stretched out toward the circumference, just as the planet really is, according to truthers. In April, after stating that he is open to allowing Japan and South Korea to develop nuclear weapons to alleviate the financial costs of the United States role as policemen to the world, Trump also suggested minimizing the authority of the United Nations. By the way, United Nations, Trump said, same thing, smaller numbers. In now deleted tweets, Trump also seemingly offered Biblical evidence of a flat earth. During an interview at ReCodes 2016 Code Conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, Elon Musk, founder and CEO of SpaceX, a company that is developing the technology to make humans a multi-planetary species by colonizing Mars, said he would suggest a direct democracy for humans on Mars, as opposed to the United States version of representative democracy. When asked about the potential Trump presidency, following the nominees flat earth claim, Musk replied, Im glad the framers of the constitution saw fit to ensure that the president was captain of a large ship with a small rudder. Theres a limit to how much harm you can do as president. I dont think its the finest moment in our democracy. When pressed further regarding the unique dangers presented by a President Trump, Musk added, Oh what the hell do I care? Im moving to Mars."	Fake

However, John protested his melodies being played on the battle field. I dont generally need my music to be required in anything to do with an American race crusade, he said in a meeting with The Guardian. Im British.

" JUST IN: Trump is BANNED From Donating to Hurricane Harvey Victims or Doing Charity work because his Charity Organisations are being investigated for PONZI style SCAMS http://londonwebnews.com/2017/09/02/just-trump-banned-donating-hurricane-harvey-victims-charity-work-charity-organisations-investigated-ponzi-style-scams/ Donald Trump will not be allowed to donate $1 million to hurricane Harvey efforts because his Charity Organisations are under investigation for scamming the American people for many years, probably decades.  Until the investigations into the scamming activities into Trumps Charity organisations are finished, Trump is literally banned from any charitable activities or from making donations. The New York Attorney General is investigating Trumps activities. Its my understanding that [the Trump Foundation] cant make donations now, while its under investigation by NY AG, Washington Posts David Farenthold tweeted Friday night. The tweet was in response to White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee-Sanders saying she hadnt yet asked the president whether the funds would come from Trumps personal checkbook or from his foundation. Donald Trump, the Presidents son also ran a charity that is under investigation after it was revealed that the charitable organisation was funnelling money donated to the charity to be used for personal reasons or to pay for events. The money funnelled out of these charities in some way ended directly in Trumps pocket. The Eric Trump Foundation is also under investigation by the New York AG after reports revealed the father and son foundations were self-dealing funds to each other. Eric Trump was the patron of St.Judes Children Hospital and used his high profile to raise millions of dollars for the hospital. An investigation later revealed that Eric Trump was funnelling millions of dollars from St.Juds Childrens hospital into his fathers organisation and businesses. Follow this link to find the detailed report on how money from Eric Trump charity foundation was shifted into his fathers businesses can be found on CNN St.Judes Childrens Hospital has since severed all ties with Eric Trump and his father. So while Trump made headlines after saying he will donate $1 million to hurricane Harvey victims, few Americans knew that actually Trumps charity organisations are under investigation for misappropriation of the millions of dollars they have collected over the years meant to help the causes they claim to support. Until those investigations are finalized, Trump and his family are not allowed to be involved in Charitable organisations, raising funds for charity, or making donations. However, Trump can continue to raise funds for campaigns and political reasons as this operates under different regulations as Charitable giving. Trump also pledged $1 million to hurricane Sandy victims in New Jersey in 2012 but 5 years later, they have never seen a dime!"	Fake

It took a couple hours to figure out what was happening, said one aide. Looking at the size of the sock, every one assumed Melania must have left it as a happy birthday gift. Shes had trouble finding her husbands office, the aide clarified. It wasnt long before the signal became clear; Sessions efforts, declared Trump, were no longer required. Thats how Trump does it, said one long-time assistance. He fires people the way his father fired the maid. Hands them an article of clothing and expects them to find the door. Confusion filled the office when an extra-large pair of Fruit of the Loom briefs were found slung over Special Counsel Robert Muellers office chair. Upon inspection, it was determined that the size did not accord with Trumps own undergarments. Mueller has since been allowed to keep his job until adequate support for his brass balls can be found."

" Ruth Ginsburg Threatens To Resign From SCOTUS If Trump Is Elected President http://therightists.com/ruth-ginsburg-threatens-to-resign-from-scotus-if-trump-is-elected/ The Supreme Court is in recess for the summer, but Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg took some time to reflect on its future composition, which will chiefly depend on who is elected president in November. Asked on Thursday about the prospect of Donald Trump being handed the job of selecting the next crop of justices, she seemed uneasy at the thought. I dont want to think about that possibility, but if it should be, then everything is up for grabs, she told The Associated Press in a wide-ranging interview that also touched on the loss of her dear friend Antonin Scalia and some of the courts biggest rulings in the term that ended in late June. I really dislike that man for a number of reasons, and although I am not supposed to put forth my personal views because of my position, I still feel obligated to do whatever I can in order to let the public know that theres still time to make the right choice, she added. Donald Trump is a man who has accumulated his vast wealth not because of his business prowess, but because of the fact that much of it was inherited from his father and grandfather. In fact, when it comes to making important decisions, I dont recall him ever making the right one, and thats not the type of man that should be at the head of this country. After opening fire at the presumptive Republican presidential candidate, Ginsberg turned to her own plans should Donald Trump actually become the new President of the United States. Theres no need to beat around the bush, so Im just going to go ahead and say it  I will resign my position as a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States if that happens. I cannot imagine performing my duties under the constant pressure of waking up in the morning and having to go to work knowing that every ruling we as an institution make will be viewed through the prism of a Trump presidency. I can tolerate this charade of a presidential campaign, but I could not live with him as president, she said. I am a woman who has lived long enough, and I am proud to say Ive had a prosperous and fulfilled life, Justice Ginsberg argued. However, I am too old and too far gone to be forced to put up with the idiotic and surreal presidency of a man who up until yesterday cared for no one else but his own deep pocket. I fear that kind of situation would go against the very principles that are the building blocks of the Constitution of the United States. I see no purpose in continuing to perform my professional duties when Im aware that everything I say and do will most likely be shot down by a man so ignorant he probably requires GPS just to find his belly button while taking a shower."

" Biden Blames Lazy American Women For The Economy: They Sit Around Doing Nothing, Only Hillary Can Force Them To Work http://therightists.com/biden-blames-lazy-american-women-for-the-economy-they-sit-around-doing-nothing-only-hillary-can-force-them-to-work/ Democratic Vice President Joe Biden wants American women to get back in the workforce to help boost the economy. If we just put all the women back to work, if they were able to afford childcare, we would increase the GDP in America by close to eight tenths of one percent, he said. Thats trillions of dollars over the next decade. Biden made his remarks during a campaign event for Hillary Clinton at Chatham University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on Tuesday. The state of our economy could be characterized by a single word: pitiful, he argued. Were still battling recession, I dont care what the official stats are saying, America is still in recession. And were not doing anything about it. He added that it was lazy American women who brought about the downfall of the economy, because they sit around on their behinds, doing nothing and squandering their days away when they could be improving the country that has given so much to them. Im not sure how exactly we got to this point, but were here and we need to move. Like, yesterday, he said. Mark my words and mark them well, he addressed the crowd. Hillary Clinton is the only one who can force American women to go to work. This is true because of a number of reasons. First, shes a woman herself and not just any woman; shes a self-made woman. So you better believe what shes saying is true and has been tried and tested in practice plenty of times. Second, Hillary Clinton understands how difficult it can be to give up the status of a free-loader when your husband is the bread-winner of the household and the wife is expected to tend to the house, the children, make sure dinner is served and always be in the mood for marital duties. Shes been all that and shes learned how to break free from it, the hard way, I might add, Biden continued. Todays women are pampered and arent used to rolling up their sleeves and getting the job done on their own, the vice president said. Theyre too dependent, too weak and too lazy to contribute to the economy. The reason for that is theyve learned how to manipulate men by employing one of the most fundamental laws of economics: when a sought-after commodity becomes short in supply, the demand for it rises even higher. Now, thats all fine and dandy when it comes to their personal interests, but if you look at the big picture, its the economy thats missing out on valuable workforce. And thats why we need to get them off their lazy behinds and get them into their workplaces. And like I said, Hillary Clinton is the only one who can do it, which is what makes her the ideal candidate for the next President of the United States. We need to heal this country, folks, not run it into the ground even deeper, Biden concluded."	Fake

No! In the Name of Humanity We Refuse to Accept a Fascist America! reads a full-page ad placed in the New York Times on Wednesday by the group Refuse Racism. Donald Trump, the President-elect, is assembling a regime of grave danger, the ad says. Millions of people in the US and around the world are filled with deep anxiety, fear and disgust. Our anguish is right and just. Our anger must now become massive resistance  before Donald Trump is inaugurated and has the full reins of power in his hands.</span> Other Hollywood celebrities who have also joined the campaign, however, are calling for an all-out strike that would span the entire movie industry in the hopes that such a move would urge the President-elect to resign from his position as the newly elected President of the United States. Were calling for a general strike that would include every single person involved in making motion pictures in Hollywood, starting with the actors and celebrities themselves and encompassing companies in charge of making props, movie memorabilia and even souvenir shops, a spokesperson for the Refuse Racism group told The New York Times. Its about time people understood that were the ones with the power and that the president is there to serve us, not the other way around. Asked to elaborate on why the group is targeting Hollywood out of all the industries in the country as their bargaining chip, the spokesperson argued that Hollywood is, simply put, the base of the entire modern American culture. It is the foundation of the country, so to speak, the glue thats holding it together. And think about what happens when you destroy the foundation of a house. It comes crashing down, right? Well, thats exactly whats going to happen to America unless Donald Trump realizes how real the danger of that actually is, and chooses to step down as President of his own free will. And while were on the subject, between you and me  nobody wants Hollywood to stop doing its thing, but this is a necessary move. Besides, its not like the billionaire-businessman-turned-president hasnt ventured into movies in his day, right? So, hell understand firsthand whats going to happen if Hollywood goes to strike. Without the work of Hollywood and the lifestyle promoted by it, there will literally be no more America to rule for Trump. So, in effect, its not us that are going to force Donald Trump to resign his office; its the people of America who are going to make him do it, because the Gods honest truth is  without Hollywood, there is no America. Its like trying to run Nazi Germany without Hitler at the forefront  it just becomes pointless, the spokesperson concluded."	Fake

In a speech made public by Wikileaks  which released an email from Hillary for America Research Director Tony Caark containing three attached speeches given at a private Goldman Sachs events  Clinton spoke and took audience questions at the Builders and Innovators Summit hosted by Goldman Sachs on October 29, 2013. Answering a question about businessmen in politics, Clinton said that they are most often the people that look over the horizon, and therefore share a vision that many politicians of today lack. And thats a very good question and thank you for asking it. Yes, I would love to see more businessmen go into politics because I believe they would bring in an entirely different mindset and strategies than what were used to seeing traditionally, she opined. And then she just had to go on. In fact, when you say businessmen and women, I cant help but think of a particular one that I would just love to see running for the presidency at some point in the future, Clinton added. I dont know what it is exactly about him, I cant quite put my finger on it, but my instinct is almost never wrong. And its telling me that Donald Trump would be very successful if he were to venture into politics in the future. Asked to elaborate on her statement, the former Secretary of State argued that she thinks that businessmen cant be bought and that theyre very honest. And I think that goes especially for Donald Trump, whose successful projects and business ventures have made him synonymous with big business and, more importantly, creating thousands of jobs. I also think he understands the philanthropic and charitable side of things quite well, which is a crucial skill for any politician, she praised her current counter-candidate. I think he has a lot to offer to this country and its people, especially when were talking about the economy, she continued. Donald Trump has single-handedly helped stop the recession, more so than dozens of other so-called billionaires. And I dont know how the experts on the matter feel, but in my book thats hard evidence of the mans business prowess and integrity, as well. And I think everyone would agree those are commendable character traits for anyone looking to tackle the most difficult problems and challenges in the world, quite literally. So, yes  Donald Trump is someone I could very easily see winning the support of the people. And I dont think he would do that with his flammable rhetoric and negotiation skills  which are both things hes known for  but with common sense and respect for his fellow countrymen. But, most of all  I think his relationship with the opposite sex would bring him the most political points. I think he respects women and treats them as equals and I also think that would bring him a significant lead over anyone unlucky enough to be running against him, she ominously concluded in her 2013 speech."

Breitbart News reported that Carlson said that AR-15s are not needed to hunt or kill deer and suggested they only serve to enable terrorists to carry out their attacks with greater efficiency. She quoted a December 2015 poll showing majority support for an assault weapons ban and said, Im with the majority today, taking a stand. Interestingly, when confronted by Second Amendment supporters on Twitter, Carlson doubled down on her pro-ban stance, claiming that the fact that youre even using the Second Amendment as an argument against banning assault weapons shows me youre ignorant. Dont you know the 2nd Amendment was written before guns were even invented? Asked to comment on her tweets, Carlson told Breitbart News that at one point, I even asked myself what was the use of trying to prove why assault rifles are bad to these people when they clearly dont possess the most fundamental knowledge of history? I felt like I was trying to teach nuclear physics to someone whos illiterate. I mean, we have Google and the Internet today. How hard was it to Google the 2nd Amendment of the Constitution of the United States? I mean, really. And what worried me even more, she continued, was the fact that it seemed like every single person that replied to my tweet was under the impression that they were right and I was wrong. So, Im sitting there, thinking, Ooookaaay, someone obviously wasnt paying attention during history class  a lot of someones, apparently  hmm, they must have been distracted by thinking about how they were off emptying 30 rounds into some innocent animal. Carlson also added, I mean, I know the education in our country isnt the best in the world, but I figured wed at least be able to each our kids the basics like math and history. But, I guess I was wrong. Whats the next thing Im going to hear, that we somehow went to the Moon and that Elvis Presley is dead? Come on, Im not buying it.

" CIA Agent Confesses On Deathbed: We Blew Up WTC7 On 9/11 http://yournewswire.com/cia-911-wtc7/ 79-year-old retired CIA agent, Malcom Howard, has made a series of astonishing claims since being released from hospital in New Jersey on Friday and told he has weeks to live. Mr. Howard claims he was involved in the controlled demolition of World Trade Center 7, the third building that was destroyed on 9/11. Mr. Howard, who worked for the CIA for 36 years as an operative, claims he was tapped by senior CIA agents to work on the project due to his engineering background, and early career in the demolition business. Trained as a civil engineer, Mr. Howard became an explosives expert after being headhunted by the CIA in early 1980s. Mr. Howard says has extensive experience in planting explosives in items as small as cigarette lighters and as large as 80 floor buildings. The 79-year-old New Jersey native says he worked on the CIA operation they dubbed New Century between May 1997 and September 2001, during a time he says the CIA was still taking orders from the top. Mr. Howard says he was part of a cell of 4 operatives tasked with ensuring the demolition was successful. Mr. Howard says the World Trade Center 7 operation is unique among his demolitions, as it is the only demolition that we had to pretend wasnt a demolition job. He claims he had no problem going through with the deception at the time, because when you are a patriot, you dont question the motivation of the CIA or the White House. You assume the bigger purpose is for a greater good. They pick good, loyal people like me, and it breaks my heart to hear the shit talk. But even he admits that now, looking back, Something wasnt right. No good has come from this. This isnt the America we envisioned. Explaining how the building was bought down, Mr. Howard says, It was a classic controlled demolition with explosives. We used super-fine military grade nanothermite composite materials as explosives. The hard part was getting thousands of pounds of explosives, fuses and ignition mechanisms into the building without causing too much concern. But almost every single office in the Building 7 was rented by the CIA, the Secret Service, or the military, which made it easier. Mr. Howard explains that WTC 7 was loaded with explosives in strategic places in the month leading up to the day that changed the course of American history. On September 11th, while the North and South towers burned, fuses were ignited in World Trade Center 7, and nanothermite explosions hollowed out the building, destroying the steel structure, removing the reinforcements, and allowing the office fires to tear through the rest of the building, hollowing it out like a shell. World Trade Center 7 collapsed into its own footprint at 5:20pm, seven hours after the destruction of WTC 1 and 2. The building shocked witnesses by coming down at the speed of freefall, indicating that it encountered zero resistance on the way down. Mr. Howard and his colleagues had done their job. When the building came down, it was such a rush. Everything went exactly to plan. It was so smooth. Everybody was evacuated. Nobody was hurt in WTC 7. We were celebrating. We kept watching replays of the demolition, we had the whiskey and cigars out, and then all of a sudden the strangest thing happened. We all started to worry that it looked a bit too smooth. We watched the tape again and again and again and we started to get paranoid. It looked like a controlled demolition. We thought shit, people are going to question this. And then we heard that people from the street were reporting that they heard the explosions during the afternoon. When we were told that the BBC botched their report and announced to the world that the building collapsed 20 minutes before it actually did At that point we really thought the gig was up. According to the official 9/11 report issued by the government, WTC 7 collapsed due to uncontrolled fires that were caused by debris that floated over from WTC 1 and 2, which had been hit by passenger planes. If the official narrative was true, WTC 7 would be the first tall building in the world to ever collapse due to uncontrolled fires, and the only steel skyscraper in the world to have collapsed into itself, due to office fires. Mr. Howard and his colleagues feared the public would see through the official narrative and rise up against the government, demanding to be told the truth. There were so many loose ends, so much evidence left behind. We thought the public would be all over it. We thought there would be a public uprising that the media couldnt ignore. Theyd be funding investigations and demanding to know why they were being lied to. We thought theyd find chemical composites in the area that would prove Building 7 was blown up.  We thought there would be a revolution. It would go all the way to the top, to President Bush. Hed be dragged out of the White House. But none of that happened. Almost nobody questioned anything. The media shot down anyone who dared question anything they were told. Follow the money Mr. Howard claims he has no direct knowledge about the destruction of North and South Towers of the World Trade Center, explaining that CIA operations are very specific and that it is common to be working on a larger project while only understanding a small piece of the puzzle. But he has advice for investigators seeking to understand the entire puzzle and work out who was behind the most devastating attack on American soil in history. Follow the money. When you want to find out who is behind something, just follow the money. Look at the trades made just before 9/11. These are the guys that knew what was coming. The sons of CIA agents, government officials. Close relatives of the most powerful men in America. Cheney, Rumsfeld. They all got rich. It wasnt just the contracts awarded to their friends in the construction business and the wars and the kickbacks. It was insider trading. Many countries including Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Monaco launched insider trading investigations in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, believing that if they could prove Al-Qaeda operatives profited on the stock market then they could prove the terror organization was behind the attacks. And all the evidence pointed to heavy insider trading around 9/11. Italys foreign minister, Antonio Martino, said: I think that there are terrorist states and organizations behind speculation on the international markets. German central bank president, Ernst Welteke, said his researchers had found almost irrefutable proof of insider trading. Even CNN reported that regulators were seeing ever-clearer signs that someone manipulated financial markets ahead of the terror attack in the hope of profiting from it. Mr. Howard says that a serious study of who profited on the stock market from 9/11 would tear the heart out of the oligarchy in America. There is only one organization that spans the entire world, and let me tell you now, it isnt and it never was al-Qaeda. Its the CIA. There could never be a real investigation. The entire shadow government, as you call them now, are implicated. The 79-year-old, spending his final weeks at home, said he doesnt expect to be taken into custody following his confession because then theyd have to go after everyone else. They will just use the media to attack me. They are all on the payroll to suppress everything around 9/11."	Fake
" Melania Trump Bans Monsanto Products From The White House http://yournewswire.com/melania-trump-bans-monsanto/ First Lady Melania Trump has banned Monsanto products from her household after learning of the health effects associated with consuming genetically modified (GM) corn. First Lady Melania Trump has banned Monsanto products from the White House after learning of the health effects associated with consuming genetically modified (GM) corn, according to reports. While public debate rages about the safety of genetically modified food, Melania Trump says that as far as she is concerned, GM products are best avoided. Barrons health has improved out of sight since we started eating organic, non genetically modified food, the First Lady said. After researching exactly where Monsantos genetically modified corn appeared in her familys diet and becoming concerned about potential negative health effects, Melania Trump said she was amazed at the place this company has in the food chain. The First Lady, who proudly describes herself as a full-time mom, then realized that Monsanto produces other genetically modified crops such as soy, sugar beets, and cotton  and these products form the foundation of many Americans diets. In the interests of her son Barrons health  as well as her own  Melania decided to eliminate processed foods containing GM crops from her family home. But as Melania explained, this wasnt as easy as it sounds. 70 to 80 percent of American processed foods contain genetically engineered ingredients, according to the Grocery Manufacturers of America. While the FDA attempts to convince us that GM foods are safe, scientists working for the agency have repeatedly warned that the opposite is true. These brave FDA scientists, speaking out against the official company line pushed by their corrupt superiors, have repeatedly warned that GM foods can create unpredictable, hard-to-detect side effects, including allergies, toxins, new diseases, and nutritional problems. They have urged long-term safety studies, but have been ignored by the agency. Health Risks Several animal studies indicate serious health risks associated with genetically modified food, including infertility, immune problems, accelerated aging, faulty insulin regulation, and changes in major organs and the gastrointestinal system. The American Academy of Environmental Medicine has asked physicians to advise all patients to avoid GM foods. Yet since 1996, Americans have been eating GM ingredients in most processed foods. Why isnt the FDA protecting us? The sad fact is that we cannot rely on the FDA to protect us. We must do our own research and educate ourselves. In the First Ladys case, her self-education led to her total ban on Monsanto tainted products in her household, exclusively ordering organic products that were not grown with GM seeds. Melania said that in order to live up to the commitment she had to do a lot of research. I have a friend who is a sustainable food advocate, and I got in touch with dozens of health food stories and manufacturers to ask where they sourced their products, the First Lady said. In order to completely avoid Monsanto products, the consumer must research the origins of their food. I spent a lot of time at farmers markets asking farmers what seed companies they buy from, googling on my phone before making purchases. It took a few months but I finally managed to get Monsanto out of my life completely. The influence that Monsanto has over U.S. food production is profound, and deeply disturbing. Once you start looking, you realize that Monsanto is everywhere. And, unfortunately, their influence is not benign. But as Melania Trump says, once you educate yourself and then make the effort to avoid Monsanto, you will find peace of mind, and the health of your family will improve."	Fake
" Police: Charlottesville Was Inside Job To Ignite Race War http://yournewswire.com/charlottesville-inside-job/ A Charlottesville police officer claims the riots, which pitched white supremacists against Antifa, were set up to further the agenda of the elites. A Charlottesville police officer has come forward to express his anger at being told to stand down by the city mayor during violent clashes between protestors. He also claims the protests, which pitched white supremacists against members of Antifa, were set up to further the agenda of the elites. We [Charlotesville police] were ordered to bring the rival groups together. As soon as they were in contact with each other, we were told to stand down. It was outrageous. We werent allowed to arrest anyone without asking the mayor first. We werent even allowed to stop the driver as he sped away. The event was being set up as far back as at least May and it went like clockwork. Michael Signer, the mayor of Charlottesville, ordered police to stand down during the most chaotic and destructive period of the protests  despite police protests against the orders. We wanted to do our job and keep the peace. But these mother******s in charge really want to destroy America. Fox News reporter Doug McKelway was on the scene in Charlottesville and he backs up the police officers claims. I can say, havig been in Emancipation Park from early on that morning, that what I saw with my own two eyes confirms what this law enforcement source told us. At least from all visible apearances. We saw people coming out of that park who had headwounds, who were bleeding from the head, people walking into that park with bats, with sticks  you saw what they were wearing  helmets, body armor, they had come  and this pertains to both sides  they had come to do damage.. you cannot help but notice from that video that police had been more pro-active, they could have potentially calmed this thing down to some degree. Michael Signer is a Virginia Democratic activist with close ties to Barack Obama and John Podesta. Before landing the Charlottesville mayor job he previously worked closely with Podesta at the Center of American Progress and worked with him again on Barack Obamas State Department Transition Team. The New World Order, led in the United States by elite operatives Obama, Podesta, Soros, Clinton and company, are pulling out all the stops to create division through chaos and destruction. Crowds of paid protestors and useful psychopaths are being sent into pitched battle against one another to sour the mood of the nation and further divide us all. They are manipulating and controlling newsworthy events in order to maintain power and control over the public, and to swing public opinion. Deep state operatives The man accused of being a neo-Nazi and murdering a woman by deliberately driving into her during protests in Charlottesville is in reality a supporter of Hillary Clinton and member of Antifa in receipt of funding by George Soros. White supremacist and Unite the Right leader, Jason Kessler, has been exposed as a supporter of former President Obama and the a hardline member of far-left Occupy movement. When did he change his political leaning? According to the Southern Poverty Law Center (an organization that is certainly no friend to Conservatives), Kessler revealed his political transformation around November 2016, the same month Donald Trump won the presidential election. If you think that is suspicious, wait until you learn about the other actors in this enormous set-up event. First man on the scene Brennan Gilmore was on the scene and was the author of the first viral tweet about Charlottesville. He was later interviewed by MSNBC. He was presented as an accidental witness. But who is he really? Gilmore worked in Africa as a State Department foreign officer under Hillary Clinton. The New York Times mentioned this coincidence  and then later deleted it. Brennan Gilmore was also involved with the Kony hoax in 2012, and he is currently Chief of Staff for Tom Perrielo, who is running for Governor of Virginia and received $380k from George Soros. So the first man on the scene, whose tweet went viral, and who was later interviewed on mainstream news as a witness, just happened to be a State Department insider with a long history of involvement in psy-ops? If you think this isnt fishy, how about this  since the Charlottesville protests and his appearance in the media, his information was suddenly removed from State Department websites. The elites know we are onto them, and they are trying to cover their tracks. They can censor Google and social media and close down accounts, but they will never be able to stop us sharing information and speaking to each other."	Fake
" NPR: 25 Million Votes For Clinton Completely Fake  She Lost Popular Vote http://yournewswire.com/npr-25-million-fake-clinton-votes/ NPR admit Hillary Clinton 'lost the popular vote' as 25 million fake votes are discovered A study published by NPR reveals that over 25 million Hillary Clinton votes were completely fraudulent, meaning that the Democratic candidate actually lost the popular vote by a huge margin.  A study by the Pew Center claiming that over 800,000 non-citizens voted for Hillary Clinton failed to take into account dead and fraudulent voters which totalled over 25 million registered voters. According to reports, illegal aliens combined with dead voters and multiple state voters explains why Hillary appeared to have won the popular vote over Trump during this years presidential race. Infowars.com reports: A report by the Pew Center on the States finds that more than 1.8 million dead people are currently registered to vote, and 24 million registrations are either invalid or inaccurate, NPR reported in 2012, which is ironic given how NPR is heavily controlled by Democrats. And many of the dead, registered voters somehow keep voting Democrat from beyond the grave, most recently in Philadelphia, Penn. and Colorado. Its also worth noting that the U.S. population has increased since 2012, meaning that theres likely more dead and invalid voters than before. The Pew study found that almost 3 million people are registered to vote in more than one state, NPR added. Thats because when a new resident registers to vote in a state, officials usually never bother to tell his former state about the change in voter residency. Under the catch and release immigration program by the Obama administration, illegal aliens were routinely given bus tickets to travel to other states by immigration officials, so it was theoretically possible for non-citizens to register to vote in a border country illegally, then register to vote in another state after their taxpayer-funded bus dropped them off. Clinton won most of the 163 most populous counties in the US that account for half of the total votes in the election, including dense urban areas in New York and California, yet she only won the popular vote by 2.8 million votes, which reveals the lack of enthusiasm voters had for her in comparison to Trump  and that Democrats would have depended more on illegal votes. A portion of the 24 million invalid voter registrations combined with a portion of the 1.8 million dead voters and the over 800,000 known illegal voters could explain the difference of 2.8 million votes, and its worth noting that the 800,000 figure could be a low, conservative estimate. That said, a popular vote victory is meaningless; if the president was elected by popular vote, then both Trump and Clinton would have campaigned in entirely different states because only densely population regions of the U.S. would decide who would become president. Without the electoral college, the United States of America would be reduced to the United States of New York and California, with 48 other vassal states. Yet notice how Clinton campaigned in other, less populated states.  They knew the popular vote was meaningless ahead of the election. However, the popular vote is useful as a barometer for voter fraud since the most populous countries are also the most susceptible to election tampering by illegal, invalid and dead voters."	Fake
" Donald Trump Hires Clueless Stacey Dash for Negro Outreach Program http://nationalreport.net/donald-trump-hires-clueless-stacey-dash-negro-outreach-program/ TRUMP TOWER  With his poll numbers among black voters hovering around 1%, presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump reportedly tapped actress and FOX News contributor Stacey Dash as his Negro Outreach Program Ambassador.  She connects with that group, said Trump, and shell be terrific. Did you see her at the Oscars? She was terrific as the Minority Outreach Director, so we brought her on board. Were lucky to have her. Shes controversial, but shes one of the good ones.  Dash recently created controversy by calling Greys Anatomy actor Jesse Williams a plantation slave after his BET Awards speech calling for an end to racism and what he called cultural appropriation.  Trump said now more than ever, especially with Crooked Hillary siphoning off my blacks, minority outreach is the difference between winning and losing in November.  You know what will happen, said Trump. The media will come down on me for saying my blacks. They did that in California with that African-American fellow in the crowd, but you know what? I dont care. Stacey will respond to all the groups we need to reach.  One of those groups is the transgender   community, Last June, the Clueless actress comments about bathroom use by transgender individuals created heated controversy. Dash said people who cant decide what they wanna be that day should go to the bathroom in the bushes. Sources say Trumps camp may even be vetting Dash for vice president. So far, Trumps short list includes New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, and former House Speaker and presidential candidate Newt Gingrich.  Shes very well-informed. Shes quite affected. Weve been looking into it, said Trump.  When asked if the term Negro was a proper term to use in 2016, a Trump spokesman said, The trouble with saying African-American is that not all blacks are from Africa, and some of them arent even Americans. Some of them are from Central America, and even Puerto Rico.  To be inclusive, we decided against colored, since the NAACP still uses that. We said no to black, because that sounded too polarizing. In the end, we went with negro. Its historically accurate. Nothing racist about it.  Not everything is about race, added the spokesman. We hope Stacey Dash will make that fact clear to you people once and for all. UPDATE: OMAROSA WILL NOT WORK WITH STACEY DASH"	Fake
" Obama To Resign January 1st Amid New Benghazi Revelations http://nationalreport.net/obama-resign-january-1st-amid-new-benghazi-revelations/  According to several senior-ranking White House officials, President Barack Obama will resign from office on January 1st 2015, after learning that a so-called Smoking Gun story regarding the Benghazi scandal will soon be revealed. Those sources claim Obama will announce his resignation shortly after the midterm elections in November.  The decision to resign came after reporters from Fox News were allegedly contacted in August by a survivor of the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attack, who came forward with shocking video evidence that Obama, then- White House Chief of Staff Jacob Lew, and then- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton knew that an attack on the US diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya was imminent, and intentionally ordered key security personnel to leave the facility and travel eight blocks away.     Sources at Fox News say that the unidentified survivor allegedly recorded a video teleconference on his cell phone in which Lew gave the orders, while Obama and Clinton watched on. You dont want a guy like Mitt Romney deciding your budget, Lew supposedly states in the video, which Fox News has not yet released. We need to win this thing, and that means we need to make some sacrifices. Let me be clear, no one will be harmed in this. Were sacrificing a few buckets of paint, thats all. We just need a little nudge in the polls.  The sources at Fox say the network was prepared to air the video on August 23rd, but House Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa (R-CA) convinced them to hold off on releasing the footage. White House sources say two unidentified reporters from Fox News joined Issa in a private meeting with Obama this past weekend, on August 30th, and agreed to not reveal the video if Obama agreed to resign. White House senior staff negotiated with Issa and the reporters so Obama could stay in office until the end of the year, and that he would announce the resignation in November, shortly after the midterms. Why they agreed to those terms is unclear.  Obamas resignation has been highly sought after by conservatives and Tea Party figures since well before he actually took office in January of 2009. The Benghazi scandal continues to ignite fiery debate across the United States, despite a full lack of evidence, until now, of any wrongdoing on the behalf of the Obama Administration. In August, it was learned that the Republican-led House Intelligence Committee cleared Obama and his team of any wrongdoing in the Benghazi scandal.  If the story proves true, Obama will resign at noon on January 1st, 2015, and Vice President Joe Biden will be sworn into office. It is unclear who the next Vice President will be, but incumbent White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough is strongly favored for the role. Bidens office reportedly scheduled emergency meetings with Nancy Pelosi, Tim Kaine, Elizabeth Warren, and Maryland Governor Martin OMalley for Tuesday and Wednesday, and some speculate these meetings might be related to a future VP decision, though no sources could confirm the rumor."

" Obama Uses Own Money To Open Muslim Museum Amid Government Shutdown http://nationalreport.net/obama-uses-money-open-muslim-museum-amid-government-shutdown/  Washington, DC  While up to 800,000 federal workers faced life without a paycheck as Day Two of the government shutdown kicked in, President Barack Obama held a press conference to announce that he is using his own money to open the federally funded International Museum of Muslim Cultures.  During this shutdown, people will have to deal with some of their favorite parks and museums being closed, Obama told reporters. Just keep in mind, they will always be there. The Grand Canyon and the Smithsonian are not going anywhere. Obama continued, The International Museum of Muslim Cultures is sacred. That is why I have taken it upon myself to use my own personal funds to re-open this historic piece of American culture.  The International Museum of Muslim Cultures closed its doors Tuesday as parts of the federal government shut down after Congress failed to reach an agreement on spending. On Monday, the Senate rejected the latest budget proposal from the House of Representatives. The fiscal standoff stems in large part from Republican attempts to block President Obamas healthcare initiative.   The Muslim community deserves our full acceptance and respect, Obama said. We have killed millions of Muslims overseas since the September 11th attacks. They are not all bad. In fact most of them are good. So during this shutdown, now is a great time to learn about the faith of Islam. I encourage all of you to celebrate the Muslim community, the Sunnah and the magic of the Quran. All of this can be found at the newly re-opened International Museum of Muslim Cultures.  Khaled Matei who is a member of the Muslim Brotherhoods Freedom and Justice Party told CNN he is pleased with Obama and his actions. I spoke with President Obama by telephone yesterday and personally thanked him for what he is doing for the Muslim community, Matei said. This is definitely a step in the right direction I explained to him. Praise Allah.  Obama finished the press conference explaining to reporters how thrilled he is to see the museum open again. Folks, this is a time to focus on things that are important to us in America. Sure, we would all like to see the government open, it just is not that simple. What is simple is me funding the International Museum of Muslim Cultures so that it can stay open during this horrible time in our nations history, all thanks to the echo chamber which is called the Tea Party.  The International Museum of Muslim Cultures is located at 201 E Pascagoula Street in Jackson, Mississippi. It is open Tuesday  Friday from 10:00 am  5:00 pm. The museum is closed Friday from 1:00 pm  3:00 pm in observance of the Jumah Prayer."	Fake

In July, Election Justice USA, for example, reported that without Clintons team committing egregious acts of voter fraud, Sanders would have been the man to lose to Donald Trump in the national election. Instead, we have Pantsuits McCriminal, and what happened Friday is absolute proof that she will do literally anything to win. Fox 10 Phoenix reports that nine illegal immigrants complete with fake identification and voter registration cards, and stolen social security numbers, voted at around 9 am a Desert Wind Middle School in Pinal County. At 10:30, the very same white van carrying the very same illegals was spotted at Santa Rosa Elementary School and they voted there as well. Just two hours later, the same group showed up at the Global Water Center to cast their vote. By this point, poll workers had been notified and one of those Poll Watchers liberals hate so much pretended to take a poll and asked them whom they had voted for. In broken English, one man who identified himself as Jose Gutierrez said I am voting for Hillary Clinton many times. And vote many times he did. Mr. Gutierrez and friends voted in two more locations, their spree ending in Maricopa County where a Sheriff was waiting for them. The nine beloved undocumented persons as Democrats call them were arrested and charged with attempted in-person voter fraud and several other charges. Unfortunately, only one will be deported. They were just enthusiastic. Most of these people do not have criminal records before this, an immigration official says, with the exception of Enrique Calderon of Mexico. The official explained that Calderon is wanted on two counts of rape and six counts of drug trafficking back in Mexico, where he will be returning soon. Why arent the rest being sent back with him?

" Obama Family Rumored to Be in the Market for Expensive Marthas Vineyard Property http://thepoliticalinsider.com/obama-marthas-vineyard-property/ President Barack Obama spent eight years warning about the supposed threat of man-made global warming, which included massive and catastrophic rising sea levels. Conservative Republicans and President Donald Trump, we were told, are on the wrong side of history when it comes to climate change. But the Obama familys actions speak louder than words. And what the Obamas just did contradicts all their talk about climate change. The Boston Globe reports the former first family is ready to spend tens of millions of dollars on a property right along that same ocean line we were warned about. Realtors arent sharing details yet, but the rumor is that they are purchasing a luxurious location in Marthas Vineyard, along with other expensive, less-populated regions to the north. Considering Obama never held a real job in his life, this is an extraordinary move: Word around the island is that the Obamas, whove rented a place on the Vineyard for the past several summers, are looking to buy. The former first family has many friends on Marthas Vineyard  Harvard professors Henry Louis Skip Gates and Charles Ogletree, and former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett, to name just a few  and they would like to own a place of their own on the island. The 44th president and his wife, Michelle, are believed to be focused up island, looking at homes or buildable lots in the rural communities of Aquinnah, Chilmark, and West Tisbury. (Its worth noting that the Obamas have always rented up island, including for a two-week stay this summer.) No ones talking, least of all realtors, but were told that one property that may be getting a long look is a magnificent waterfront outpost in Aquinnah owned by Caroline Kennedy and her husband, Edwin Schlossberg. A few years ago, the couple, who inherited from Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis the 377-acre Red Gate Farm overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, subdivided the property and put two parcels on the market. Both are still available  but they dont come cheap. Sothebys International Realty and Hancock Real Estate in Chilmark are listing a 75-acre parcel for $15 million, and a second 40-acre parcel for $12 million. The descriptions for each read like something out of a fairytale: The vast acreage and exquisite dune-fringed sands give the sense of a world apart in an idyllic landscape which has remained virtually unchanged over the centuries. Perched on a southwest-facing ridge, the potential homesite commands glorious views to the oceans brilliant blue waters and sunsets in the midst of this sublime seaside paradise of pastoral coastal heathlands and high dunes. And as shown by real estate websites, the property would be the exact wrong place to buy a home if you believe Al Gores predictions about rising sea levels: The lots, such as the one shown above, cost approximately $15 million and thats just the cost before any home is built. The luxurious properties must be built to withstand erosion of land and require unique painting to avoid damage due to the surrounding salt water. And none of that includes serious issues involving licensing, zoning, permits, and ground preparation. Another reason to laugh at the Obamas is they may be building on top of land that was stolen from Native Americans! The Obamas need to check all permits, and [see] if their land can be subdivided, and if its on Wampanoag land, says Julianne Kavoussi, who has owned a home in the Edgartown part of the Vineyard for 20 years. The Wampanoag are Native American people who, she says, own a good portion of Aquinnah. It wasnt long ago that we learned Al Gores house uses 34 times the amount of energy used by the average American household. Now, the Obamas are being the hypocrites we always knew they were."	Fake

" CLINTON DESCRIBES SANDERS SUPPORTERS AS BASEMENT-DWELLERS & BARISTAS IN LEAKED RECORDING https://www.infowars.com/clinton-describes-sanders-supporters-as-basement-dwellers-baristas-in-leaked-recording/ Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton made forthright remarks about Bernie Sanders supporters during a private meeting with fundraisers, an audio  from which has been leaked following an email hack. Theres just a deep desire to believe that we can have free college, free healthcare, that what weve done hasnt gone far enough, and that we just need to,  you know, go as far as, you know, Scandinavia, whatever that means, and half the people dont know what that means, but its something that they deeply feel,  Clinton said during a Q&A with potential donors in McLean in Virginia, in February, when she was still in a close primary race with Sanders. The frontrunner to become the next US President said that herself and other election observers had been bewildered by the rise of the populist,  nationalist, xenophobic, discriminatory Republican candidates, presumably Donald Trump, on the one side, and the radical left-wing idealists on the other. Clinton painted herself as a moderate and realistic contrast to the groundswell. I am occupying from the center-left to the center-right. And I dont have much company there.  Because it is difficult when youre running to be president, and you understand how hard the job is  I dont want to overpromise, said Clinton,  who has customarily eschewed political spectrum labels. According to the Washington Free Beacon, which posted the audio of Clintons remarks,  the recording was attached to an email sent out by a campaign staffer, which has been hacked. It is unclear if the leak is the work of the same  hackers who got hold of a trove of Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails in July. In the session, Clinton called for an understanding of the motives of Sanders younger backers, while describing them in terms that fluctuate  between patronizing and unflattering. Some are new to politics completely. Theyre children of the Great Recession. And they are living in their parents basement. They feel they got their education  and the jobs that are available to them are not at all what they envisioned for themselves. And they dont see much of a future, said Clinton, who obtained the  support of about 2,800 delegates, compared to approximately 1,900 for Sanders, when the results were tallied in July. If youre feeling like youre consigned to, you know, being a barista, or you know, some other job that doesnt pay a lot, and doesnt have some other  ladder of opportunity attached to it, then the idea that maybe, just maybe, you could be part of a political revolution is pretty appealing. Despite well-publicized tensions, particularly between the more vocal backers, Sanders endorsed Clinton at the Democratic National Convention two months  ago, and the two politicians have campaigned together this week, sharing the stage. Following the leak, the Clinton campaign has not apologized for the audio,  insisting that it shows that the nominee and is listening to the concerns of the most diverse, open-minded generation in history. As Hillary Clinton said in those remarks , she wants young people to be idealistic and set big goals, said her spokesman Glen Caplin.  She is fighting for exactly millennial generation cares more about  a fairer, more equal, just world. In other parts of the 50-minute recording, Clinton spoke about US capacity to retaliate against foreign hackers that would serve as a deterrence and  said she would be inclined to mothball the costly upgrade of the Long Range Standoff (LRSO) missile program."

" REPORT: THREE MILLION VOTES IN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION CAST BY ILLEGAL ALIENS https://www.infowars.com/report-three-million-votes-in-presidential-election-cast-by-illegal-aliens/ Three million votes in the U.S. presidential election were cast by illegal aliens, according to Greg Phillips of the VoteFraud.org organization. If true, this would mean that Donald Trump still won the contest despite widespread vote fraud and almost certainly won the popular vote. We have verified more than three million votes cast by non-citizens, tweeted Phillips after reporting that the group had completed an analysis of a database of 180 million voter registrations.  Number of non-citizen votes exceeds 3 million. Consulting legal team, he added. According to current indications, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by around 630,000 votes, although around 7 million ballots remain uncounted. Virtually all of the votes cast by 3 million illegal immigrants are likely to have been for Hillary Clinton, meaning Trump might have won the popular vote when this number is taken into account. Vote fraud using ballots cast in the name of dead people and illegal alien voters was a huge concern before the election. On the morning of the election there were 4 million dead people on U.S. voter rolls.

" BOMBSHELL: AT LEAST 25 MILLION DEAD AND FRAUDULENT REGISTERED VOTERS IN 2016 https://www.infowars.com/bombshell-at-least-25-million-dead-and-fraudulent-registered-voters-in-2016/  A study revealing that over 800,000 non-citizens voted for Hillary Clinton doesnt account for dead and fraudulent voters, which accounted for over 25 million registered voters during the 2012 presidential election  and little has changed since then. Illegal alien voters combined with dead and multiple state voters could easily explain Clintons popular vote margin over Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election, especially considering that her victory came from Democratic-controlled counties known for illegal immigration and loose voter ID laws such as in New York and California. A report by the Pew Center on the States finds that more than 1.8 million dead people are currently registered to vote, and 24 million registrations are either invalid or inaccurate, NPR reported in 2012, which is ironic given how NPR is heavily controlled by Democrats. And many of the dead, registered voters somehow keep voting Democrat from beyond the grave, most recently in Philadelphia, Penn. and Colorado. Its also worth noting that the U.S. population has increased since 2012, meaning that theres likely more dead and invalid voters than before. The Pew study found that almost 3 million people are registered to vote in more than one state, NPR added. Thats because when a new resident registers to vote in a state, officials usually never bother to tell his former state about the change in voter residency. Under the catch and release immigration program by the Obama administration, illegal aliens were routinely given bus tickets to travel to other states by immigration officials, so it was theoretically possible for non-citizens to register to vote in a border country illegally, then register to vote in another state after their taxpayer-funded bus dropped them off. Clinton won most of the 163 most populous counties in the US that account for half of the total votes in the election, including dense urban areas in New York and California, yet she only won the popular vote by 2.8 million votes, which reveals the lack of enthusiasm voters had for her in comparison to Trump  and that Democrats would have depended more on illegal votes. A portion of the 24 million invalid voter registrations combined with a portion of the 1.8 million dead voters and the over 800,000 known illegal voters could explain the difference of 2.8 million votes, and its worth noting that the 800,000 figure could be a low, conservative estimate. That said, a popular vote victory is meaningless; if the president was elected by popular vote, then both Trump and Clinton would have campaigned in entirely different states because only densely population regions of the U.S. would decide who would become president. Without the electoral college, the United States of America would be reduced to the United States of New York and California, with 48 other vassal states. Yet notice how Clinton campaigned in other, less populated states.  They knew the popular vote was meaningless ahead of the election. However, the popular vote is useful as a barometer for voter fraud since the most populous countries are also the most susceptible to election tampering by illegal, invalid and dead voters."	Fake

" VOTE FRAUD: More Than 5,000 Out-of-State Hillary Voters May have Tipped New Hampshire Against Trump http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/09/vote-fraud-5000-state-democrats-may-voted-hillary-new-hampshire/ More evidence of voter fraud in New Hampshire has surfaced. It is now believed that over 5,000 out-of-state voters may have voted for Hillary Clinton on election day in New Hampshire because the state allows same-day registration.  New Hampshire was a close race in the 2016 Presidential election. Hillary won the four electoral votes, however; it took a week to count the votes because it was tight. Hillary received 348,521 votes, while Trump picked up 345,789. Trump   lost by 0.4 percent.  As previously reported, Hillary Clintons former top campaign lawyer, Marc Elias is behind a New Hampshire lawsuit to block a law which would force people who are registering to vote to show a form of I.D. Figures.  The Democrats are pulling out all the stops to prevent voter I.D. laws because without illegal aliens, dead people or people being bussed in to vote, the Democrats would never win another election.  Via Washington Times:  More than 6,500 people registered to vote in New Hampshire on Nov. 8 using out-of-state drivers licenses, and since then the vast majority have neither obtained an in-state license nor registered a motor vehicle.  Conservatives say the states same-day registration is an invitation for fraud because of loose proof-of-residence rules. New Hampshire House Speaker Shawn Jasper, a Republican, issued the numbers Thursday based on inquiries he made to the Department of State, which oversees elections, and the Department of Safety. Here are the numbers:  6,540 people registered and voted on Nov. 8, based on presenting out-of-state licenses.  As of Aug. 30, about 15 percent (1,014 of the voters) had been issued New Hampshire drivers licenses.  ?f the remaining 5,526, barely more than 200 (3.3 percent) had registered a motor vehicle in New Hampshire.  New Hampshire law gives drivers 60 days upon establishing residence to obtain a state license.  But more than 80 percent of voters who registered on Nov. 8 using out-of-state drivers licenses, or 5,313 of them, neither had a state license nor registered a motor vehicle almost 10 months later.  It is well known that people are bussed in to vote in New Hampshire. This is why the Democrats are fiercely working to stop any investigation into vote fraud and are working to prevent any type of voter I.D. laws. Strict laws would have tipped New Hampshire in Donald Trumps favor."	Fake

The mainstream media has neglected to report on a BIG find by Dr. Ben Carson. The Trump cabinet is a winning cabinet.  Dr. Carson dug into the agencies records in a sweeping audit wherein he found substantial bookkeeping errors, which only prove either the incompetence or the corrupt nature of the previous administration led by former-president, Barack Obama.  The HUD report found $500 billion in fraud and mismanagement in the government agency.  What We Found  The total amounts of errors corrected in HUDs notes and consolidated financial statements were $516.4 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. There were several other unresolved audit matters, which restricted our ability to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to express an opinion. These unresolved audit matters relate to (1) the Office of General Counsels refusal to sign the management representation letter, (2) HUDs improper use of cumulative and first-in, first-out budgetary accounting methods of disbursing community planning and development program funds, (3) the $4.2 billion in nonpooled loan assets from Ginnie Maes stand-alone financial statements that we could not audit due to inadequate support, (4) the improper accounting for certain HUD assets and liabilities, and (5) material differences between HUDs subledger and general ledger accounts. This audit report contains 11 material weaknesses, 7 significant deficiencies, and 5 instances of noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations.  We took a screenshot of the .pdf file that outlines the findings by Dr. Carson and his team:  So far the Trump administration has had opposition from the left and the mainstream media.

Now, its come to light that Clinton apparently funneled over $800,000 from her campaign money to her new political PAC, Onward Together, which is backing several groups of resistance against the current administration, including ANTIFA. As a presidential candidate, Clinton railed against dark money groups like Onward Together.

Clinton doesnt even deny that she is supporting such groups. In an email signed by her that went out last week asking for money, Clinton wrote, You may not have heard much about the work were doing at Onward Together, Clinton wrote. Thats because were working behind the scene to fund, support, and amplify the work of the groups were supporting. Were not the story: they are. Each of five political groups that were mentioned were contacted by The Daily Caller and asked if they were being funded and supported by Onward Together. Out of those five, only one group, the Soros-backed Indivisible, responded. Onward Together has not given any financial support to us, Helen Kalla, an Indivisible spokesperson, wrote in an email.

The group also will not be revealing those identities, something that is only occurring to protect the guilty.

Its been almost a year since the election, and now Hillarys blaming married women who voted for Donald Trump for her loss to the president back in November.Still unwilling to take any responsibility for her loss to Donald Trump, Hillary continues to play the blame game.  So far, shes blamed everyone from her most trusted advisor, Huma Abedin, to the infamous socialist and fellow democrat Bernie Sanders, for the disastrous campaign and ridiculous ideas she championed last year. But she doesnt stop there anymore. Now its the fault of married women who voted for Donald Trump. According to the Daily Wire, the quintessential modern feminist Clinton says women were too scared to stand up to their husbands, boyfriends, and fathers, who told them to vote Republican, and since, clearly, women have no agency or ability to think for themselves, they listened.  Of course, thats according to Hillary. But she blamed socialist women as well. Clinton made the outrageous claims in an interview with NPR,where she also blamed the so-called Bernie Bros for bullying Democratic women into avoiding the more moderate Clinton in favor of the socialist, Bernie Sanders. You yourself in the book acknowledge that a good number of young women didnt vote for you, which is presumably not a sexist choice. They just werent inspired by your message, NPRs Rachel Martin said during an interview with Clinton, out to promote her litany of excuseserrecently released book, What Happened. I think its a lot more complicated than that, Clinton answered. I did win the womens vote. I didnt win the vote of white women, but I got more white women votes than Barack Obama did, she said. Women will have no empathy for you because they will be under tremendous pressure  and Im talking principally about white women  they will be under tremendous pressure from fathers, and husbands, and boyfriends and male employers, not to vote for the girl, she said. Daily Wire. But Clinton also said that even though women liked and respected her (an observation American women might disagree with generally) they were too afraid to stand up to the oppressive Patriarchial hand that often forces them to hide their allegiance to womankind. Clinton also tried pretty hard to convince NPR that she is taking the blame for her loss, but no one is buying this snake oil anymore: I take ultimate responsibility for the loss, Clinton said. I was the candidate. I was the person whose name was on the ballot. And Ill never get over that.

" D.C. satanists: Sally Quinn of Washington Post used hexes to kill people http://www.dcclothesline.com/2017/09/15/d-c-satanists-sally-quinn-of-washington-post-used-hexes-to-kill-people/  For some time now, the Alternative Media have been saying Washington, D.C., is a nest of satanists. Given the fact that D.C. is where the politically powerful congregate, it stands to reason that the city would be a special target of satanists. What better way than to corrupt and bring down the United States, still the most powerful country in the world? Last year, we learnt that John Podesta, a longtime Clinton associate who chaired Hillary Clintons 2016 presidential campaign, partook of a satanic ritual called spirit cooking dinner  a sacrament in Thelema founded by British satanist Aleister Crowley whose motto was Do As Thou Wilt, in which menstrual blood, breast milk, urine and sperm are ingested. (See Evidence that Hillary Clinton and her associates are satanists) Yesterday, we learnt that Hillary Clinton who, were it not for the grace of God, would be the U.S. president now, admitted she had wanted to make and stick pins into voodoo dolls of her critics. Today, youll find out about a very powerful D.C. woman who put hexes on her enemies. A curse is an expressed wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall another (or a place or object). A hex is more than a curse: To hex someone is to call upon a supernatural power, by means of magic or witchcraft, to bring ill on another. According to Wikipedia, the word hexing comes from the German word for witchcraft. Sally Quinn, now 76, is a former Washington Post (WP) reporter who became the third (and last) wife of the late WP executive editor and later, vice president, Benjamin Bradlee. Bradlee became a celebrated and national figure during the presidency of Richard Nixon when he challenged the federal government over the right to publish the Pentagon Papers and oversaw the publication of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernsteins stories documenting the Watergate scandal. Together, from their marriage in 1978 until Bradlees death in 2014, the couple were among D.C.s most powerful, dominating the citys social scene as its gatekeepers. In 2006, Quinn wrote that her parents were religious but didnt go to church, and that she was an atheist since the time she was a small child because she could not believe in a God who allowed evil and bad things to happen to people, including her (unnamed) sickness when she was ten years old. John Nolte reports for Breitbart, Sept 12, 2017: For nearly 50 years, the entire social and political world of DC revolved around this couple. Bradlee and Quinn were the New Camelot (his career took off in large part because of his friendship with John F. Kennedy), the Gatekeepers of who was in and who was out, the Elite Deciders among our Ruling Class with the extraordinary power of the Washington Post, and by extension the rest of the mainstream media, to abuse and weaponize their will against the rest of us. Well, to put it as bluntly as possible, we are now learning that the Queen of Camelot is an occultist, a witch of sorts who honestly believes (according to her own new memoir) that she murdered three innocent people through the dark art of the hex: a young woman who committed suicide after flirting with Quinns boyfriend; a magazine editor who published an unflattering profile of her, who decades later died of cancer; a psychic who died of a cerebral hemorrhage before the end of the year after telling Quinn something she did not want to hear. [] Quinns other acts of admitted wickedness include plotting to break up Bradlees marriage (which she did) and using the threat of adultery to bend Bradlee to her will. Quinn practiced the occult in the most demonic ways imaginable well into adulthood. She finally stopped hexing others, not out of a sense of remorse, but because she thought she was karmically responsible for the unusual illness of her and Bradlees only son, Quinn. Quinn Bradlee was born in 1982 (when Sally Quinn was 41 and Ben Bradlee was 61) with a rare and incurable disease called velo-cardio-facial syndrome, aka DiGeorge syndrome, 22q11.2 deletion or Shprintzen syndrome. Caused by the deletion of a small segment (30-40 genes) of chromosome 22, the syndrome occurs in only 1 in 4,000 people with afflictions that can include congenital heart problems, specific facial features, frequent infections, developmental delay, learning problems, cleft palate, kidney problems, hearing loss, and autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and Graves disease. Nolte points out that what is almost as troubling as Sally Quinns witchcraft is the matter-of-fact way in which the Washington Post informs us of this bombshell under the chatty headline, Sally Quinns hexes, marital ultimatums and visceral love of her son. Nolte writes: We have just discovered that one of the primary movers and shakers of the last half-century is a practicing occultist, and Nothing. Nobody cares. The information is dropped as though Quinns tell-all is the usual-usual about plastic surgeries and sex. Worse still, our Ruling Class is now joking about Quinn putting a deadly hex on President Trump. [] Lets just say it out loud The most powerful people in our country are either outright occultists, are comfortable with witchcraft and Satanism, or are moving and shaking among those who are. Whether or not you believe in the power of the occult, that does not matter. Also beside the point is whether or not the Podestas and Quinn and those calling to have Trump hexed believe. What we do know is that these people have completely rejected any notion of a loving God, and moved towards darkness. Furthermore, we also know that this darkness is not about consenting adults behaving badly amongst themselves. Rather, this is about them attempting to harness a power to control others, to manipulate events to their will, to hurt or outright kill those who offend or insult them. What is remarkable is that, although he was born with a hole in his heart and underwent heart surgery when he was three months old, after which he spent many years in and out of hospital and attended special schools for severe learning problems, and although he never received a religious education, Quinn Bradlee is a believing but non-church going Christian. In 2006 when Quinn was 24 years old, he told his mother that he believes in God. He said: My image of God is what Michaelangelo painted on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. God is a man stronger and more powerful than everybody else. I also believe that if you think about God, if you say his name all the time, then you will believe in him. It will be in your subconscious. . . . I knew you and Dad were not very religious people . . . . I didnt really understand that you didnt believe in God until a few years ago. I didnt know what atheist meant. Its a very harsh word, very ugly word. Its like calling a black person the N word. . . . Everything happens for a reason. Maybe its Gods plan for me to go through this because I can handle it. . . . In a way, believing in God is like having a girlfriend that you love and care about. You feel safe with her. You feel safe with God, the way you would with your girlfriend. When you get married she will be with you in sickness and in health. Thats what I believe God will do when Im going through the hard times of life. Now 35 years old, Josiah Quinn Bradlee is a filmmaker, author and advocate for the disabled. "	Fake
" Court Claims Nothing Wrong with Rigging PrimariesDismisses Lawsuit Against DNC  http://www.dcclothesline.com/2017/08/29/court-claims-nothing-wrong-with-rigging-primaries-dismisses-lawsuit-against-dnc/ The lawsuit brought about by Bernie Sanders supporters against the Democratic National Committee and its former chairperson Debbie Wasserman-Schultz has been dismissed after a court conceded that the DNC and Wasserman-Schultz rigged the primariesbut were well within their rights to do soseriously. After first assuming all the plaintiffs allegations were true, for the purposes of weighing their claims, Judge William Zloch dismissed the lawsuit on several grounds. The plaintiffs alleged fraud on the part of the DNC in three different ways: 1. The DNC did not remain unbiased as evidenced through the DNC emails Wikileaks published. 2. Donors to the DNC were defrauded because they donated to Bernie Sanders as a Democrat candidate and the fix was in for Hillary Clinton. 3. The potential for identity theft was demonstrated when the DNC failed to keep its database of donors and their personal information confidential. As Michael Sainato writes in the Observer, Zloch, dismissed the lawsuit after several months of litigation during which DNC attorneys argued that the DNC would be well within their rights to rig primaries and select their own candidate. In evaluating Plaintiffs claims at this stage, the Court assumes their allegations are truethat the DNC and Wasserman Schultz held a palpable bias in favor Clinton and sought to propel her ahead of her Democratic opponent, the court order dismissing the lawsuit stated. Zloch concluded the plaintiffs failed to prove they were materially affected by the alleged bias with which the DNC engaged. He wrote: The Court must now decide whether Plaintiffs have suffered a concrete injury particularized to them, or one certainly impending, that is traceable to the DNC and its former chairs conductthe keys to entering federal court. The Court holds that they have not. The overwhelming opinion of those who have actually read WikiLeaks leaked DNC email database appears to be that the DNC, Wasserman-Schultz, and the mainstream media all colluded to ensure Clinton would earn the DNC nomination. This was evident on numerous occasions, many of which were caught on live video and openly admitted. As The Free Thought Project has extensively reported, influential donors to the DNC are suing their political party for fraud in the 2016 presidential election where they say their candidate, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, was discriminated against. High-ranking members of the DNC, by way of Wikileaks DNC email publications, were caught favoring Hillary Clinton over Sanders and actively working to subvert his chances at winning the partys nomination. Judge Zloch dismissed the lawsuit on technicalities (several of the plaintiffs lived outside of the courts jurisdiction) and precedents (donors to nonprofits have no legal recourse as to what the organization does with the donations). Zloch never really addressed the claims of the plaintiffs, only whether or not they had a legal claim for damages. Zloch admonished the plaintiffs his court was not the place to air their grievances. Instead, they should have done so at the ballot box, inside the DNC, and to work inside the systema system they clearly believe to be rife with corruption. Zloch wrote: This Order, therefore, concerns only technical matters of pleading and subject-matter jurisdiction. To the extent Plaintiffs wish to air their general grievances with the DNC or its candidate selection process, their redress is through the ballot box, the DNCs internal workings, or their right of free speechnot through the judiciary. Zloch dismissed the case against the DNC and Wasserman-Schultz by declaring, the Court finds that the named Plaintiffs have not presented a case that is cognizable in federal court. One of the plaintiffs in the case, Jared Beck, went off! Heres what he had to say in response to the dismissal and its epic! His rant starts at the 9-minute mark. His reaction describes the deaths of process server Shawn Lucas, DNC data manager Seth Rich, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Beranton Whisenant alludes to the Deep State, and points the finger of blame at the Military Industrial Complex. What really disappoints me about our society, H.A., is the fact that we had two witnesses die in this case, and I still have these f***ing people who call themselves journalists mocking us denigrating us for being concerned about that. Ya know, it goes beyond a lack of awareness in this country. This country has a vicious, corrupt core and the MOST vicious, corrupt people are sitting in D.C. right now, running the show and forming the media elite and establishment that surrounds and protects them, and promulgates their bullshit all over the airwaves. And I am sick and f***ing tired of living in this country and having those be the people that run the show. We see our clients lose in court, all the time. We see them get shafted by the healthcare system, get shafted by this country, and nobody in this country gives a f*** about them, whos in the leadership. Let me tell you something: I know that those problems the problem in this country, in terms of corruption I know that its so deep-seated Its taken root over many, many decades, and its not going anywhere any time soon. But my HOPEmy hope in filing this lawsuit was that at least it might be some kind of spark to get things rolling, so that by the time my kids are adults in this society, theyre not living under an immoral, oligarchic, tyrannical piece-of-shit government that f***ing goes to war in MY name, with my tax dollars, on a perpetual basis and f***ing incinerating people, and I have NO f***ing channel to STOP it. And as an American, I am ashamed. I am ashamed to call myself an American. And let me tell you something else: There were people in Nazi Germany who didnt know what the f*** was going on, either They were f***ing clueless. They were f***ing brainwashed. And Im not making this comparison because of any bullshit comparison between Trump and Nazism thats going around that the mainstream media wants you to believe. What Im talking about is the REAL government we have in this country. And in my view, they are morally equivalent, or worse, than the government of Nazi Germany Because theyve been going on longer, and theyve been f***ing over not just everybody in THIS country, but around the world. And Im f***ing sick of it, as a human being. The dismissal of the DNC voter fraud lawsuit of 2017 will go down in history as a whimper in the annals of unsuccessful movements against the Deep State and its actors. But, perhaps, Becks comments will remain as a testament to just how powerful the establishment is, and the lengths to which they will go, including allegedly murdering anyone who gets in their way.

Basically, he was flying around in a private 727 with a bunch of rich Democrats in a mobile den of iniquity.  Senator Shermans office says they regret the news and expect the Senator to answer questions for himself when hes done being processed and interrogated. US Attorney Gil Gabriel of the 2nd District of Washington says Sherman should be in front of a judge for a bail hearing tomorrow.  Investigators have taken control of the Senators home and office and are now searching for a list of his customers, as the only people on board for the raid were the Senator, three crew members, seven casino workers and a half dozen or so prostitutes  both male and female.  Democrat leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuch Schumer havent released official statements, but Pelosi is said to have been especially distraught at the news.  They were probably customers.

" Why Didnt FBI Dir James Comey Prosecute Hillary? Maybe this $6 Million Connection Will Explain http://newsfeedobserver.com/why-didnt-fbi-dir-james-comey-prosecute-hillary/ By Ian Fortey Ian Fortey May 21, 2017 79,678 views  It seems fired FBI Director James Comeys ties to the Clinton Foundation and the confiicts of interest are deeper, closer than we thought.  According to Gateway Pundit:  Comey served as general counsel at Lockheed Martin until 2010 when he departed with over $6 million to show for it. That same year Lockheed Martin became a member of the Clinton Global Initiative and won 17 contracts from the U.S. State Department, which was led by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Big League Politics reports.  Comey just so happened to have joined the board of the British bank HSBC Holdings in 2013, which just so happens to be a Clinton Foundation partner.  However, one of the most shocking (and important) confiicts of interest of note is this: Comeys brother, Peter Comey, works for the Washington law firm DLA Piper, and serves as its Senior Director of Real Estate Operations for the Americas.  So, who is DLA Piper, you ask? Well, DLA Piper happens to be one of the top ten alltime career campaign donors for Hillary Clinton. On top of this, DLA Piper also happens to do the Clinton Foundations taxes. And if that isnt telling enough, DLA Piper also performed the 2015 audit of the Clinton Foundation when the scandal first broke.  Per Big League Politics:  Property records show that James Comey owns the mortgage on his brother Peter Comeys house in Virginia. Therefore, James Comey had a direct financial relationship with a DLA Piper executive at the time he was investigating Clinton.  These relationships, though egregious, are symptomatic of the brazen culture of crony capitalism that exists in our nations capital. The public usually is prevented from learning these kinds of things, with the mainstream media blocking information from coming out. Sunlight is the only remedy.  When President Donald Trump finally fired James Comey as FBI director, Tucker Carlson said that everyone in Washington knows it was well past due."	Fake
" BREAKING: Democrat Senator That Ran Sex And Drugs Party Plane Sells Out His Customers http://newsfeedobserver.com/democrat-senator-that-ran-sex-and-drugs-party-plane-sells-out-his-customers/ US Senator Marshall Sherman of Vermont is finding out quickly that there is little room for his kind of shenanigans in Donald Trumps America. After being caught red-handed on a private plane with a crew of casino workers and hookers, Sherman has decided that he will disclose his list of regular customers in exchange for a plea deal to a lesser charge.  The deal means Sherman will have to quit the Senate and spend 18 months in jail, but in return, the US Attorney gets to prosecute every politician and lobbyist on the list for ethics violation and solicitation, since amounts collected for use of the whores was uniform and identifiable.  Democrats are struggling to have the evidence suppressed for National Security reasons, as there is some speculation that there are ranking members of classified committees on the list. President Trumps office weighed in that nobody who participated in such debauchery as gambling, booze and sex illegally will be getting a free ride.  Marshalls full confession will be released as soon as prosecutors have had the chance to file charges against those deserving of a good dose of justice.

" Black-and-White Evidence That Proves US Government Engaged in Forced Sterilizations, Mind Control, Weather Modification, False Flag Operations and Igniting Wars (Videos)  (N.Morgan) When vital government documents are declassified or leaked, the evidence held within those pages are useful tools in getting to the truth of what is really going on in the world.  This evidence also assists in validating researchers and investigators who are often shut down, censored and dismissed as conspiracy theorists.   Emigrate While You Still Can! Learn More... The internet is quickly becoming a digital censorship grid, where corporate technological behemoths like Google (who owns YouTube) and Facebook will rig algorithms (which control search engine results and news feeds) to elevate the information they want you to see and bury the information they dont want you to see.   Amazon also plays a part in this emerging multinational corporate technological oligarchy, and you may remember they have been caught censoring books in the past (such as No One Died at Sandy Hook by Jim Fetzer) by refusing the book sales on their platform.  Declassified documents are tangible and vital pieces of evidence that expose the shocking extent to which groups of people, using and hiding behind the concept of government, have committed egregious crimes against humanity. Its hard for naysayers and censors to deny the authenticity of government declassified files which show our history is full of conspiracy fact, not conspiracy fiction.    Declassified Files #1: Operation   Think that World War II ended with the defeat of the Nazis?   Think again. They didnt get defeated; they just went south (Argentina) and joined the ranks of their conquerors (US, UK, Russia) in a dirty deal of legal immunity for inside information.  The German scientists, technicians and engineers had made brilliant and groundbreaking advances in many fields in the leadup to and during the war, and the victors didnt have a moral problem with the Nazi weapons of destruction  the only problem was that the brilliant scientists were on the wrong side.  The US got a sizeable portion of these Nazi scientists (around 1500) and smuggled them into NASA and the CIA, where some of them such as Wernher von Braun went on to make a name for themselves. Thus, the US willingly allowed its military and intelligence agencies to be infected with Nazi ideology, which continues to this day.  The declassified docs relating to Project Paperclip or Operation Paperclip are here.    Declassified Files #2: The Escape of Hitler and Other Nazis to Argentina  The mainstream narrative is that at the end of WWII, Hitler committed suicide in Berlin in a bunker. Its a nice story, but apparently, thats all it is  a story.  In his book Hitler in Argentina: The Documented Truth of Hitlers Escape from Berlin, author Harry Cooper produced a slew of astounding evidence that Hitler and other top Nazis such as Martin Bormann traveled in German submarines all the way to Argentina.  Some of the evidence which supports the truth of this astonishing claim is found in these FBI declassified docs.  The article FBI Quietly Declassified Secret Files Attesting Hitler Fled to Argentina in 1945 contains further information.    Along with the FBI documents detailing an eye witness account of Hitlers whereabouts in Argentina, more evidence is coming to light to help prove that Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun did not die in that bunker.  In 1945, the Naval Attach in Buenos Aires informed Washington there was a high probability that Hitler and Eva Braun had just arrived in Argentina.  This coincides with the sightings of the submarine U-530. Added proof comes in the form of newspaper articles detailing the construction of a Bavarian styled mansion in the foothills of the Andes Mountains.  Further proof comes in the form of architect Alejandro Bustillo who wrote about his design and construction of Hitlers new home which was financed by earlier wealthy German immigrants in Argentina.   [an] archeologist from Connecticut State, Nicholas Bellatoni was allowed to perform DNA testing on one of the skull fragments recovered from the bunker. What he discovered set off a reaction through the intelligence and scholarly communities.  Not only did the DNA not match any recorded samples thought to be Hitlers, they did not match Eva Brauns familiar DNA either.    Declassified Files #3: Operation Northwoods  Operation Northwoods was the outrageous plan for the US military to attack its own people and cities (Washington DC and Miami) as a false flag operation to frame Cuba.  It was a pretext to invade Cuba.  The 1962 declassified US Joint Chiefs of Staff Memo is entitled Operation Northwoods  Justification for US Military Intervention in Cuba.  In its own words, the document states that a series of well coordinated incidents will be planned to take place in and around Guantanamo to give genuine appearance of being done by hostile Cuban forces.  Luckily JFK had the nous to reject the plan; by 1962, he had discerned the insidious influence of Military Intelligence Complex upon his presidency.  The declassified docs for Operation Northwoods are here.    Declassified Files #4: CoIntelPro  CoIntelPro has become a famous word of its own, derived from the full operational name Counter Intelligence Program. This was a program run by the FBI under Hoover which started in 1956.  CoIntelPro was a series of undercover operations that targeted people and groups the US Government deemed were a problem, such as the communist party, other far left groups, civil rights groups, far right groups (e.g. the KKK) and individuals activists such as Martin Luther King.  The scope of CoIntelPro was broad: it involved monitoring, surveilling, infiltrating, discrediting and disrupting.  Although then Attorney General Robert Kennedy authorized some spying, the FBI was given an inch and took a mile (much like todays spy agencies), clearly overstepping the bounds of legality. It became a way for the government to intimidate and stifle dissidents.  Declassified docs on CoIntelPro are here.    Declassified Files #5: Operation Mockingbird  Operation Mockingbird was a CIA disinformation project to infiltrate and covertly control the mainstream media.  It began in the 1950s under then CIA director Allen Dulles.  The declassified files (most are classified and secret, but a tiny fraction are here) show how the CIA infiltrated the mainstream media and had its pieces inserted into TV, newspapers and journals everywhere as news when they were nothing more than lies and propaganda.  Richard Salant, former President of CBS News, once said that our job is to give people not what they want, but what we decide they ought to have.   Mockingbird was famously exposed in the 1975 Church Committee hearings with CIA Director William Colby testifying that over 400 CIA agents were active in the US media, to control what was reported through American mainstream television, newspapers and magazines.    Journalists worldwide are still on the payroll, and some were brave enough to talk about it, such as the late Udo Ulfkotte.  See Also: Hollywood and The CIA: A Dark Marriage Revealed    Declassified Files #6: Operation MKUltra  Operation MKUltra has become so infamous that the term is basically synonymous with mind control. The MK of MKUltra stands for mind kontrolle (German spelling of control), with a nod to the German Nazi scientists who were brought in under Paperclip and developed it for the CIA.    In 1953, CIA agent Richard Helms (later CIA director in 1966) chose Dr. Sidney Gottlieb to run the TSS (Technical Service Staff) to develop truth serum drugs, hypnotic techniques and mind control techniques, with the purpose of creating spies, couriers and assassins.  Eisenhower approved using Nazi scientists and Jewish victims as guinea pigs. MKUltra was so large it had 149 sub-projects. By 1953, the emphasis of MKUltra was LSD (see below), but by the 1960s, this had changed into biological radio communications.    Helms later destroyed much of the MKUltra archive when he left in 1972, but some declassified files remain.    Declassified Files #7: Operation Midnight Climax  Operation Midnight Climax, one of many MKUltra sub-projects, used paid prostitutes to lure people into CIA safe houses in San Francisco, Marin and New York.  There, they were surreptitiously given a wide range of substances, including LSD, and monitored behind one-way glass.  This was not the first time, nor the last, that the US Government used drugs and other substances with which to experiment upon unsuspecting individuals.  The point was to study the effects of LSD and gain research on the potential military and intelligence uses of sexual blackmail, surveillance technology and mind-altering drugs.    Some of the declassified files are available here.  See also: Declassified Documents Disclose CIA Mind Control Programs    Declassified Files #8: CIA Drug Smuggling  The CIA has for many years used illegal drugs to fund its illegal operations. Drugs are often one of the secret motivation behind wars.  Vietnam is part of the Golden Triangle of heroin-producing opium poppies, Afghanistan is also home to huge swathes of opium poppies, and after the US invaded many Central and South American countries, it took control of the cocaine production operations there.  In 1996, journalist Gary Webb exposed the connection between the CIA, cocaine and the Nicaraguan contras.  In the early 1980s, the CIA pushed the sale of cocaine in Los Angeles to help finance their covert war against the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. (Also see: The Clinton Body Count)  You can read some of the declassified files on the CIAs connection to the drug trade here, including excerpts from Oliver Norths notebook obtained under the FOIA.  North writes that Air Force General Richard Secord told him (North) that 14 M to finance [the arms in the warehouse] came from drugs.    Declassified Files #9: Operation Gladio  Operation Gladio, which still continues to this day, is the codename for a clandestine NATO stay-behind operation in Italy during the Cold War.  The CIA spearheaded Gladio under the pretext of preventing the spread of Soviet communism in Europe.  The name gladio is the Italian form of gladius, a type of Roman shortsword.  Gladio came to refer to a whole range of stay-behind cells and groups in Europe, although originally, Operation Gladio was the Italian branch.  Gladio became famous when then Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti talked about it.  Gladio involved the Freemasons, Mafia members and the Vatican, who all united with the CIA and NATO in a holy war against communism.  Operation Gladio was responsible for some horrible atrocities and false flag attacks in Italy, such as the bombing of Bologna train station in 1980.  Today, even the Western-backed fighters in Nazi Ukraine and Syria are basically Gladio fighters.  Declassified files on Gladio can be found here.    Emigrate While You Still Can! Learn More... Declassified Files #10: Forced Sterilization Programs  The United States Government has a long and sordid history of using its own people as guinea pigs and unwitting subjects for experimentation, much of which was done without their knowledge or consent. Some of this came in the form of forced sterilization programs.    The article, Forced Sterilization of Native Americans, describes a particular program aimed at Native American Indian women:  During the late 1960s and the early 1970s, a policy of involuntary surgical sterilization was imposed upon Native American women in the United States, usually without their knowledge or consent, by the federally funded Indian Health Service (IHS), then run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA).  It is alleged that the existence of the sterilization program was discovered by members of the American Indian Movement (AIM) during its occupation of the BIA headquarters in 1972.  A 1974 study by Women of All Red Nations (WARN), concluded that as many as 42 percent of all American Indian women of childbearing age had, by that point, been sterilized without their consent.  A subsequent investigation was conducted by the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO), though it was restricted to only four of the many IHS facilities nationwide and examined only the years 1973 to 1976.  The GAO study showed that 3,406 involuntary sterilizations were performed in these four IHS hospitals during this three-year period. Consequently, the IHS was transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services in 1978.  Declassified files are here.    Declassified Files #11: Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment  One of the darkest episodes in the history of the US Government, the Tuskegee syphilis experiment was a nefarious clinical study conducted by the US Public Health Service which began in 1932 and lasted all the way to 1972.  The point was to study the natural progression of untreated syphilis in rural African American men who thought they were receiving free health care from the government.  It involved knowingly giving the men syphilis without their knowledge, telling them they just had bad blood, then watching them as the disease progressed. The researchers (or perhaps better put, sadists) deliberately didnt treat the men with penicillin which was found in the 1940s to be an effective cure for syphilis.  Meanwhile, numerous men in the study died of syphilis, 40 of their wives contracted the disease and subsequently 19 children were born with congenital syphilis.  Declassified files are here.    Declassified Files #12: Operation LAC and Operation Dew  Human experimentation has not just been limited to the injection of diseases and sterilization.  There have also been tests upon the population which have involved spraying entire areas with pathological agents  sometimes natural, sometimes man-made biological warfare agents.  Two examples of this are Operation LAC (Large Area Coverage) and Operation Dew, both carried out by the US Army Chemical Corps in the 1950s, both of which involved dispersing tiny zinc cadmium sulfide (ZnCdS) particles (which were fluorescent) and plant spores (lycopodium) from an aircraft over much of the country.  The goal was to ascertain the dispersion and geographic range of the sprayed agents.  The Government said it was safe at first, but according to the National Library of Medicines TOXNET database, the EPA reported that Cadmium-sulfide was classified as a probable human carcinogen.  Some of the declassified files are here.    Declassified Files #13: Project Sunshine  Body snatching and experimentation upon dead bodies (cadavers) is also a documented fact when it comes to governmental crimes.  During the 1950s, the US AEC (Atomic Energy Commission) and US Air Force conducted a study on the global health effects of fallout from nuclear weapons testing.  The AEC wanted to learn more about how strontium-90 (a radioactive isotope of strontium) affected human tissue and bones, so they secretly collected (stole) over 1500 tissue samples from the bodies of dead babies and young children from around the globe  without consent.  Project Sunshine was declassified in 1959.    Declassified Files #14: Operation Popeye  All those who are still skeptical about the reality of chemtrails, cloud seeding and geoengineering programs will want to review this evidence.  Operation Popeye was a weather modification program in Southeast Asia (mainly Laos and Vietnam) from 1967 to 1972.  The purpose was to aid US efforts in the Vietnam War.  Specifically, it was a cloud seeding operation which aimed to extend the monsoon season (targeted over areas of the Ho Chi Minh Trail) by inducing rain over the infiltration routes in North Vietnam and southern Laos and therefore to interdict or at least interfere with truck traffic between North and South Vietnam  as written in this memo from the Deputy Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs (Kohler) to Secretary of State Rusk.  Chemtrails were also utilized in WWII as a smoke curtain in battle. Check out the footage below:    See also: Revealed  US Senate Document Confirms National and Global Weather Modification (Geoengineering) Programs    Declassified Files #15: Iran Flight 655  The US and Iran have been on tense terms for a long time.  In 1953, the US decided to target Iran with one of its now famous regime change programs to overthrow the democratically elected Mossadegh and replace him the puppet dictator Shah who was happy to give the US and UK a cut of the Iranian oil profits.  Then, during the Iraq-Iran War of the 1980s, the US took the side of Iraq against Iran.  Towards the end of the 1980s (July 3rd, 1988 to be exact), Iran Air Flight 655 (a commercial flight) was travelling along a standard flight path through Iranian airspace on the way to Dubai.  Just a few minutes after taking off, it was shot down by the US Navy, killing all 290 people on board.  The Navy lied and stated they thought Flight 655 was an attacking fighter plane, and that they had attempted radio contact but received no response.  However, declassified documents (here) reveal a different story.  The truth was that the US only used emergency radio frequencies but not air traffic control frequencies, and also that the Navy cruiser registered the plane was climbing at the time, not descending as an attacking plane would be. Some of the files were declassified in 1988 and others in 1993.       Declassified Files #16: Unit 731  This one is another shocking event in the annals of governmental crime, although in the case the perpetrator was the Japanese Government.  Unit 731 refers to a covert biological and chemical warfare research and development unit of the Japanese Army located in China during World War II.  Under the command of General Ishii, the Japanese committed war crimes and lethal human experimentation upon around 300 people, mostly Chinese victims (though there were some Mongolian, Russian, Korean and Allied POWs too).  At the end of the war, the Japanese were caught, but in a familiar tale, the US traded immunity for data (a common theme which also happened with Project Paperclip).  The Unit 731 researchers were secretly given immunity by the US in exchange for the data they gathered through human experimentation.  Wikipedia quotes Hal Gold on Douglas MacArthur (Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces), who wrote to Washington that, additional data, possibly some statements from Ishii probably can be obtained by informing Japanese involved that information will be retained in intelligence channels and will not be employed as War Crimes evidence.  Some of the declassified files are here.    Declassified Files #17: Gulf of Tonkin Incident  Vietnam was a brutal and devastating war, that changed a generation of young people and forever marred history because it was a war deception and greed, hidden under the veil of patriotism and liberty.  LBJ, fresh from his role in the Kennedy assassination, decide to plunge the US into war in 1964 by making shit up.  He claimed that the US ships were being fired upon int he Gulf of Tonkin, but it was an utter lie.  In 2005 and 2006, NSA documents were declassified showing that the second Gulf of Tonkin incident, which was used as a justification for the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution (which led to the Vietnam War), never happened.    Declassified Files #18: Project Stargate  Project Stargate was the code name for a secret US Army unit established in 1978 at Fort Meade, Maryland, by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and SRI International (a California contractor).  The goal was analyze psychic phenomena (remote viewing, ESP, clairvoyance, astral travel, etc.) and see if they could be weaponized for military and intelligence purposes.  The original founders of the program were Russell Targ, Hal Puthoff and Ingo Swann  nicknamed the Psi Spies by the late Jim Marrs.  The Project had various predecessors and offshoots (such as Gondola Wish, Grill Flame, Center Lane, Sun Streak and Scanate) until 1991 when they were consolidated and renamed under the umbrella term Stargate Project.  At one point, the late Major General Albert Stubblebine was in charge, the same one who was outspoken in exposing the 9/11 false flag operation, and who was the husband of health and nutrition activist Dr. Rima Laibow.  The CIA terminated Project Stargate in 1995, deeming that it had provided no use.  Find declassified files here.    Declassified Files #19: Project 1794  Project 1794 is black-and-white proof that the US military, specifically the USAF (US Air Force), was developing UFOs or flying saucers.  In 2012, the USAF revealed that its Aeronautical Systems Division had plans to produce a UFO craft in the 1950s.  The craft vehicle was designed to reach speeds of Mach 4, an altitude of 100,000 feet and have a range of over 1,000 nautical miles. The project was abandoned in 1961.  Find declassified files here.    Declassified Files #20: Majestic 12 or MJ-12  Majestic 12, also known as MJ-12 or MJ 12, was a shadowy group which was allegedly given the task of overseeing the alien question during the aftermath of WWII, the start of the Cold War and the aftermath of the 1947 UFO Roswell crash.  Many researchers and whistleblowers have drawn the conclusion that MJ-12 was the core group within other groups which controlled access to extraterrestrial technology.  Some of its members included famous people such as Vannevar Bush, who was also instrumental in the development of weather manipulation programs (as exposed by Peter Kirby in his research on what he calls The New Manhattan Project).  Respected UFO researcher Bob Wood (together with his team including son Ryan Wood, UFO researcher Nick Redfern, UFO researcher Stanton Friedman, Timothy Cooper, Jim Clarkson and the late Jim Marrs) has made a website with many Majestic docs available.  You can read these MJ-12 files here. They have their own system of rating the documents for authenticity.  The document above was authenticated MJ-12 document written by former CIA chief Allen Dulles.

" Houston Residents Being Sprayed with Deadly Neurotoxins  Houston Residents Being Sprayed with Deadly Neurotoxins Emigrate While You Still Can! Learn More... Red Alert: HOUSTON OFFICIALS WARN LOCAL RESIDENTS TO USE GAS MASKS AS C-130 GUNSHIPS RAIN DOWN TOXIC SPRAY IN FIGHT AGAINST MOSQUITOS. THE PROBLEM IS, WHAT IF A RESIDENT AND THEIR FAMILY CANNOT AFFORD TO BUY GAS MASKS? WILL THE SAME BE DONE TO PEOPLE IN FLORIDA?    A serious situation is developing in Houston as people operating with orders from an unknown source, are spraying a  highly toxic substance, banned in several countries, on the people of of Houston.  The authorities are telling the people to don gas masks? Really? What if a family cannot afford gas masks? Also, Houston citizens need to be asking an important question: Are there millions of gas masks available for purchase in Houston?  Further, if there is no other choice. why arent the federal relief funds being used to purchase gas masks for the citizens? And how would these gas masks be distributed?  I have handled and worn gas masks before they are difficult to put on and they are even more difficult to remove. What about the elderly or the infirm? What are they to do? What about the children, or infants, what is going to protect them? The spraying of these residents is the best example of depraved indifference that I have ever witnessed.  A Slow Burn Genocide In short America, this is a slow burn genocide for the people of Houston. Now whether this genocide is intentional or an unavoidable tragedy, one can debate the circumstances surrounding this human holocaust. However, there is one unavoidable factor that cannot be debated. The mosquitos which are being sprayed, will not bite and infect all Houston residents, not even close.  CONVERSELY, EVERY HOUSTON RESIDENT WILL BE EXPOSED TO THIS BANNED NEUROTOXIN WHICH IS PROVEN TO CAUSE CANCER AND A WHOLE HOST OF COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL PROBLEMS.  Which is worse, to get sprayed and have a 100% chance of being exposed to life threatening toxins or to do nothing and have a small chance of being bitten by a mosquito, that may or may not be infected with maladies? I would take my chances on being exposed to the mosquitos.   Naled to the Wall The neurotoxin that the Air Force is using is called naled, which is in the organophosphate category of insecticides, and the EU banned Naled in 2012 out of concern for ITS EXTREME TOXICITY: The scenarios evaluated in the human health risk assessment as well as in the environmental risk assessment showed a potential and unacceptable risk, wrote the European Commission in its ruling.  American health officials disagree. Both the Centers for Disease Control and the US Environmental Protection Agency stand behind naled, stating the small amount of the insecticide sprayed from planes doesnt expose people enough to pose a health concern. Please allow me to don my Common Sense hat. Watch the following and ask yourself if this looks like a small amount of neurotoxin being sprayed upon the residents of Houston,  to you?  What does your Common Sense tell you? Does this look like a small amount or are you, like myself, beginning to have doubts about the story the Air Force and the EPA are telling the news media?  Additionally, the Air Force stated, in a press release, saying the insecticide will be used in volumes the EPA considers safe. Bravo Sierra! Isnt that what the soldiers were told who were exposed to Agent Orange in Vietnam, or Corexit in the Gulf following the Gulf oil spill? Who do they think they are kidding?  The neurotoxin, in question, caused the Governor of Puerto Rico to call out the army and prevent its distribution in a similar situation. Texas Governor Abbott needs to do the same thing for his people and the mayor of Houston needs to be driven from office for gross negligence and depraved indifference.  Texas Governor Abbott is a good man. He needs to step up and do what the Governor of Puerto Rico did to protect his people from the insane Deep State and I would bet my bottom dollar that this is where this is coming from.  Meanwhile, my advice to the good people of Houston is to leave the area, at least for the short-term."	Fake
" INTEL INSTITUTE: MELANIA TRUMP HAS THE HIGHEST IQ OF ANY FIRST LADY IN AMERICAN HISTORY  This post was written by Shelby Carella Melania Trump, the beautiful wife of President Trump, isnt just a beautiful model that is a great role model to young women, but she is also the smartest. Melania Trump speaks a shocking 5 languages. Thats 4 more than Michelle Obama, and 2 more than Jacky Kennedy, who used her knowledge of French and Italian to help JFK negotiate with leaders across the Globe.  Melania knows Serbian, Slovenian, German, French, and English. She knows a bit of a lot of di??erent languages. From the Week: She grew up in communist Yugoslavia and speaks ??ve languages Slovene, English, French, Serbian and German, if you want to know. That linguistic prowess could come in handy at White House functions, but it has been suggested her thick accent is the reason she makes few public speeches alongside her immigrant-bashing husband. Melania was raised away from the glamour of New York high society in a concrete tower block in then Yugoslavia during the rule of Marshal Josip Tito. Now that her husband has become president, Melania is the ??rst ??rst lady to be born in a communist nation and only the second to be born abroad, after Louisa Adams, the English wife of sixth president John Quincy, who served from 1825 to 1829. Her native Slovenia wants to help the USs relationship with Russia Melanias home country appears to believe her rise to the White House could be an opportunity to increase its own standing in the world. Tiny Slovenia, with its population of two million, has positioned itself as a possible mediator between the US and Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who rarely makes trips to western states, has visited Slovenia twice and the two nations have a comfortable relationship with one another. Prime Minister Miro Cerar told the Associated Press last year: If the United States and Russia give some initiative in this way, Slovenia could become a bridge between the two powers. Donalds apparent soft spot for Russia may mean Slovenias services are not required. However, Cerar said he had spoken to Melania in a phone call following the Trump election victory, both chatting in their native tongue. Intel scholars have proven her IQ is the highest based on her self made fortune and her knowledge of many languages. Shes also the best looking first lady in history."	Fake
" Obama Sent MILLIONS Of Dollars To Fund A Terrorist Group It is safe to say that America has a pretty bad past with the Democratic leaders. First we had Jimmy Carter when he held back the Iranian army, thus leading to Irans terrorist state to take over the Iranian government. Then, Bill Clinton waged Monicas War on Iraq. And, of course from recent history, our beloved Obama Where do we start with this one  First of all, he didnt wait long after his inauguration to send our troops in Iraq. This enabled Iran to take over Iraq. This cost us  500 American soldiers.  While he was at it, his Secretaries of State, Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, helped him to create a negotiation platform directly with Iran.  According to former CIA Analyst Fred in Obamabomb, A Dangerous and Growing National Security Fraud, the nuclear deal with Iran and the Obama administrations defense of it are full of deceptions and dishonesty.  Then we had false narratives to the media that saluted the disturbing deal they made. And as if that wasnt enough,  the Obama Administration provided $150 BILLION in sanctions relief directly to Iran! Yet they failed to mention to Iran that they attempted to gain nuclear bomb capabilities.  After that, on January 17th, 2016, Obama sent $400 million by an unmarked cargo plane. The money was sent as an exchange for four Americans being held captive by Iran. But, the deal didnt stop here. Obama also released seven Iranian terrorists that were being held captive by the U.S.Oh, oh, and lets not forget the  $1.3 BILLION he sent to Iran, JUST BECAUSE! Guys, this lunatic led our country for 8 years! Glad thats over!  But, the story doesnt end here A report released by Jewish News Service Yeshiva explains exactly where that sum ended. Get ready for this: the money was sent to a terrorist group, Hezbollah.  s Jewish News Service Yeshiva reports:  According to a Saudi Arabian newspaper report on April 25th, Hezbollah had received $600 million worth of Iranian aid. The Al-Youm newspaper reported that the aid was transferred almost completely in hard cash, and is being used for the terror groups institutions and salaries paid to its terrorists and their families.  Hezbollah is a terrorist organization that is headed by Hassan Nasrallah, its Secretary general. It was conceived by Muslim clerics and funded by Iran primarily to harass the Israelis who had entered Lebanon to increase stability in the north. Its leaders were followers of Ayatollah Khomeini, and its forces were trained and organized by a contingent of 1,500 Revolutionary Guards that arrived from Iran with permission from the Syrian government, which was in occupation of Lebanon at the time.  Hezbollah receives money from several sources including monies received from Shiite businessmen abroad, charity taxes, profit from Shiite websites in Iraq; and money received from Shiite imams in Iraq and abroad.  Arent you glad that Hillary didnt win? Imagine what would have kept on going! Imagine how much more money would have been sent to fund other terrorist groups!"	Fake
" 3 Liberal Celebrities Arrested For Conspiracy To Assassinate President Trump https://worldpoliticsnow.com/2017/04/breaking-3-liberal-celebrities-arrested-for-conspiracy-to-assassinate-president-trump/ Liberals have been going nuts ever since their hero, the criminal Hillary Clinton, lost the election. They just cant believe that Donald trump, a man who stole the hearts of a huge majority of Americans, won in such a landslide. Even though the people have spoken, liberals think they should get their way. Their heroes, a bunch of tree-hugging Hollywood celebrities, have been leading that charge whenever possible. This morning, new details came out that are shocking even to conservatives. The Secret Service has arrested three liberal celebrities in an apparent conspiracy to assassinate the president. You heard that right. They arent protesting and they didnt just make threats, they were actually conspiring to kill President Trump.  Special Agent Lucas Kimball, head of the Secret Service task force on credible threats against the president, told Breitbart: This was a real plan to not only murder a sitting president but to take half a building and most likely a lot of other innocent lives with him. We were surprised that these three people were capable of such evil thoughts. They insist that they will be remembered by history as the people who tried to stop the next Hitler. Liberalism is, in fact, a mental disorder. The three liberals were arrested as enemy combatants and brought to a military base due to the threat of mass destruction by means that are being called domestic terrorism. The Secret Service turned them over to CIA interrogators and werent going to release their names, but after just a few minutes of enhanced interrogation, all three cracked and gave up anyone involved. The three to be charged with terrorist threats, conspiracy to commit murder and treason are Actors Seth Rogan and James Franco and singer/songwriter Miley Cyrus. All three will be arraigned in federal court Monday morning. They implicated more than a dozen others who will face conspiracy charges but those names arent being released until theyve been picked up and interrogated themselves to see just how far this thing goes. Jeff Derpinger, from the White House Office of Information and Propaganda, says the president is safely sheltered in place for now until the threat has been neutralized."	Fake

" Sharyl Attkisson: It Looks Like Obama Did Spy on Trump Just Like He Apparently Did to Me  Investigative journalist, Sharyl Attkisson was one of the many people targeted by the Obama administration for surveillance.  Her personal computer and CBS laptop were hacked after she began filing stories about Benghazi that were unflattering to the Obama administration. Attkisson wrote a New York Times bestseller documenting this called Stonewalled.  On Wednesday, Attkisson wrote an Op-Ed for The Hill titled, It looks like Obama did spy on Trump, just as he apparently did to me in response to the CNN report that Obamas FBI indeed wiretapped Trumps former campaign manager Paul Manafort.  Attkisson said in her op-ed that many in the media are missing the bigger story with the wiretapping reports. The Obama administration spied on political opponents, journalists and members of Congress and asks if the intel agencies are indeed weaponized.  She also points out a pattern that every time CIA Director John Brennan or DNI head James Clapper were caught spying, they would falsely deny such accusations.  Attkisson points out that the media is happy to push propaganda for the government rather than report the truth:  Then, as now, instead of getting the bigger story, some in the news media and quasi-news media published false and misleading narratives pushed by government interests. They implied the computer intrusions were the stuff of vivid imagination, conveniently dismissed forensic evidence from three independent examinations that they didnt review.  Attkisson concludes:  Officials involved in the surveillance and unmasking of U.S. citizens have said their actions were legal and not politically motivated. And there are certainly legitimate areas of inquiry to be made by law enforcement and intelligence agencies. But look at the patterns. It seems that government monitoring of journalists, members of Congress and political enemies  under multiple administrations  has become more common than anyone would have imagined two decades ago. So has the unmasking of sensitive and highly protected names by political officials.  Read the full op-ed here.  Attkisson also posted her Obama-era surveillance timeline which is bone chilling to read.  In the timeline, Attkisson reveals when she began to be targeted by the Obama admin and how it progressed.

" JUST IN: As Trump And The DOJ Reopen Hillarys Investigation, She Escapes To Another Country!  In light of new events, we have learned that after President Trump instructed the DOJ to reopen Hillary Clintons investigation in regards to her email hacking affair, she might be fleeing the country.  Where to, one might ask?  Well, as reports suggest, Hillary is packing her back to fly to good ole Canada.  Talk about feeling the need to chill!  Hillary and husband, Bill Clinton will pay a visit to the country, alongside daughter Chelsea and two grandchildren, residing at an estate in Quebec, known as Manoir Hovey.  Whether this is a long-term commitment or a short-term agenda is still unclear, but Hillary does have many reasons to abandon her homeland.  The timing is also immaculate, as Barack Obama decided to also leave for Indonesia, when the Susan rice case reached a boiling point.  After Rices testimony was delayed, which must have come as devastating to Obama, who was looking to avoid the drama.  The Democrats sure are travelers by nature!  Once the news of Hillary traveling to Canada broke, the Internet had a blast commenting.Take a look:  Are they seeking asylum ?   pump jack (@SheldonTwin24) August 9, 2017  great, more illegal asylum seekers in QC.

" Whaaaat? Trump Chief Was Wiretapped Both Before and After the Election! http://dailysurge.com/2017/09/whaaaat-trump-wiretapped-election/ After months of the Obama Administration and the entire left wing media complex denying it, the truth comes out. Its UNBELIEVABLE or PREDICTABLE depending on present company.  According to CNN:  US investigators wiretapped former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort under secret court orders before and after the election, sources tell CNN, an extraordinary step involving a high-ranking campaign official now at the center of the Russia meddling probe.  The liberal media is shrieking in an attempt to turn the story against Trump by being shocked at the fact a candidate would be spied upon. Totally forgetting the fact that they have spent months spinning the fact that no surveillance ever took place.  So many questions. Was Manafort cooperating to hurt Trump? Why was a FISA warrant issued and who signed off on it?  CNN Continues:  It is unclear when the new warrant started. The FBI interest deepened last fall because of intercepted communications between Manafort and suspected Russian operatives, and among the Russians themselves, that reignited their interest in Manafort, the sources told CNN. As part of the FISA warrant, CNN has learned that earlier this year, the FBI conducted a search of a storage facility belonging to Manafort. Its not known what they found.  The plot thickens. Stay tuned to see where this twist of events leads.  Blood is in the waterno one can tell yet just whose it is. Only time will tell."	Fake

They carried signs that said Lock her upin Hell! and Send her straight to Satan! People certainly do have contempt for the woman. Clintons doctor said that while she wasnt there long, her condition and death were drawn out and excruciating. Basically, she died the same way the people shes murdered over the years did.  Hopefully she felt completely helpless as her third death in as many weeks makes its way across social media with the majority of people choosing not to believe it. Unfortunately, fake news has gotten so bad that conservatives like us, who tend to have a lower IQ and education level but better jobs than liberals, tend to believe what we want to believe.

" Obama Spied On Trump! One Of The Few Real Journalists Shares Her Experience With Wiretapping! https://www.usapoliticstoday.com/attkisson-obama-wiretapping-trump/ Most of the mainstream press is obsessed with attempting to cover ex  President Barack Obama and his employees that spied on many people doing work for Donald Trump campaign, however, not everyone. One reporter who still knows what her occupation should really be about is Sharyl Attkisson.  In the Hill, Attkisson has a brand-new op-ed showing off the bigger story her colleagues tend to be ignoring. The way the Obama Administrations acted symbolized the weaponization of intel organizations.  She notices that Team Trump is not really the first focus of the earlier administration, that secretly spied Congress associates during the Iran nuclear offer discussions, wiretapped inspection journalists in 2010, spied on Rep. Dennis Kucinich, and wiretapped Senate staffers in 2014.  Attkisson ought to know  she had been one of the objectives:  The government consequently got caught tracking journalists at Fox, The Associated Press, and, when i claim in a federal legal action, my computer systems while I functioned as an correspondent at CBS.  After that, as right now, instead of obtaining the bigger report, some within the news media as well as quasi-news press published fake and deceptive narratives pressed by federal government interests. These people implied the PC intrusions had been the things of brilliant imagination. They easily ignored forensic proof coming from three independent assessments which they didnt overview. All were happy to let information of the governments illegal behavior disappear, rather than reach the truth.  Sharyl Attkisson fights hard to prove wiretapping on herself and Trump by the Obama administration.  I have invested more than 2 yrs. litigating up against the Department of Justice for that computer attacks. Forensics have exposed dates as well as methods of a few of the illegal actions. The software utilized was exclusive to a government intel organization. The criminals used the keystroke checking program. They hacked the business computer system, wiretapped my chats through actual computers mic and used Skype to steal files.  We made it through the governments latest try to dismiss the lawsuit. There is yet another hearing Friday. Till now, the Trump DOJ like the Obama DOJ is battling within court to keep hidden the identities.  Attkisson continues to lay out the government constant expansion regarding its questionable spying endeavors in recent years, beginning with year 2011 growth of its power to wiretap on Americans, resulting in shocking 30, 000 US residents wiretapped in 2016. This is a (extreme surge from 9, 500 in 2013), and the NSA acknowledging shortly prior to the 2016 political election to breaking privacy rights with much larger frequency compared to previously recognized.  Officials responsible for the wiretapping of US citizens are positive their activities were lawful and not criminally motivated. But consider the patterns. The governments wiretapping of journalists, members in Congress as well as political foes is becoming more common. Nobody thought of this 20 years ago. Therefore, has the sharingof delicate and extremely guarded names by politics officials.  This really is larger than Donald Trump or Barack Obama.

" Hillary Clinton Was Caught Giving $800.00 To Fund Antifa!! http://freshdaily.news/hillary-clinton-was-caught-giving-800-00-to-fund-antifa/ Hillary plagued by scandals as she never learned her lesson. This woman was caught in a domestic terrorist funding scheme. It was pretty clear to all of us that Soros and his cohorts control the Antifa, we saw the Antifa paychecks and we witness that all pro-socialist oriented groups use the same narrative and have the same attitude, but nobody expected that the sore loser Hillary is still involved is flash mobs and domestic terrorism. Read more below: We couldnt make this kind of stuff up if we tried. Hillary Clintons corrupt behavior has her in hot water again. She failed miserably at brainwashing the masses of Americans that she attempted to during the 2016 Presidential Election, and now she has done something that really has Americans turning their backs on her for good. Federal Election Commission filings have proven that Hillary Clinton has given $800,000 from her personal campaign funds to her new political action group, Onward Together. The Daily Caller explained that Clintons dark money group received the $800,000 directly from her 2016 failed presidential campaign. This was right before the group launched back in May. There is a huge catch. Offended America has reported that the money actually went to the terrorist organization, Antifa. Clinton is backing up these resistance groups like Antifa that are simply local terrorist organizations. During the 2016 Presidential Election, Clinton was caught criticizing all dark money groups. Ironically enough, now she has her very own. After Hillary Clintons epic fail in the 2016 Presidential Election, it seemed quite obvious that her power was becoming limited. This is a woman who had made her entire living taking monetary donations from other corrupt people. It might have been her descent into irrelevance that pushed her to make the decision to form her own super-PAC. Whatever it was, she did. There were doubts that Clintons PAC was even making use of all the donation money they had received, but the Daily Caller spoke to five separate Antifa affiliated groups. Only one of these groups actually denied donations from Clintons group, Onward Together. A Soros-linked group, called Indivisible, did deny any financial gain from Clinton or her group, Onward Together. Clinton had explained that her intention was for Onward Together to be part of the resistance. Her intentions are clear. She is trying to counter President Donald Trump with violent action and protests. The groups mission statement even says that they are working towards encouraging people to organize, get involved, and run for office. They are hoping to push progressive values and work to build a brighter future for generations to come. This woman doesnt even deny her involvement with such groups. Clinton actually signed an email, which was sent out last week, that requests money. She wrote you may not have heard much about the work were doing at Onward Together. Thats because were working behind the scene to fund, support, and amplify the work of the groups were supporting. Were not the story: they are. It still baffles me how more than 65 million people voted for a CAREER CRIMINAL like Hillary Clinton. We really dodged a bullet during last years election cycle. Hillary Clinton has a good chance to leave the USA, go on some island in the third world countries and stay there until the rest of the days living a luxurious life. Thats the best possible scenario for her and her equally, if not worse, corrupted husband. As long as she continues to be involved in scandals like this, shes getting closer to where she really belongs-jailhouse."	Fake

" CDC Proposes Rule to Apprehend and Detain anyone, anywhere, at any time, for any duration, without Due Process or right of Appeal - and administer FORCED Vaccinations! http://www.redflagnews.com/headlines-2016/cdc-proposes-rule-to-apprehend-and-detain-anyone-anywhere-at-any-time-for-any-duration-without-due-process-or-right-of-appeal-and-administer-forced-vaccinations The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has proposed a rule giving them the power to apprehend and detain anyone, anywhere, at any time, without Due Process or any right of appeal, and to hold that person in quarantine for as long as the CDC wants -- and no one can refuse them!   Editor's Opinion:  This is the kind of tyranny that the Second Amendment is designed to protect Americans from.    Based on CDC's 8/15/16 publication of  ' Rules for the Control of Communicable Diseases', the CDC is giving itself the power to forcibly apprehend healthy people  en masse, and detain them indefinitely with no process of appeal.  Kindly enough the CDC is giving the public until 10/14/2016 to comment on its new found extra-Constitutional power, and whether there are any public concerns with the absence of a specific maximum apprehension period in the regulation.   Of course and as would be expected from a totalitarian unconstitutional power grab, When an apprehension occurs, the individual is not free to leave or discontinue his/her discussion with an HHS/CDC public health or quarantine officer.   Moreover, the CDC also would like the public's input on the fact their power is not limited to just individual persons but rather they could apprehend entire cities in mass if they so desired: HHS/CDC specifically requests public comment on this proposed provision to issue Federal orders to entire groups rather than individuals. And as is to be expected since its impossible to give a medical examine to an entire city, the CDC would also like your comments on the fact the proposed practice to issue Federal orders before a medical examination has taken place.  For those wishing to give the CDC their requested comments on their new found powers, the link to make such comments can be found under the SOURCE links at the end of this article. Anyone who is interested would do well to read the CDC's entire publication in the Federal Register.   The CDC's claimed power follows these Stages:  You (or your city) are declared precommunicable  Apprehension and Detention [A&D] Order of Isolation, Quarantine, or Conditional Release  In stage 1: CDC defines precommunicable stage to mean the stage beginning upon an individual's earliest opportunity for exposure to an infectious agent, as previously indicated CDC does NOT need to give a medical exam to declare you (or your city) precommunicable. In fact, you may be perfectly healthy, unexposed, and uninfected. All that is required is for someone to say they suspect you (or your city) had a nebulous general and poorly defined opportunity for exposure.  Moreover, you don't even get any due process to prove you had zero opportunity to be exposed until after CDC has proceeded on to Stage 3; The rub being the CDC can hold you (or your city) at Stage 2 indefinitely with no appeal by never proceeding to Stage 3. ie Do Not Pass Go, Go Directly To Jail.   In Stage 2: CDC sneaks in its unlimited and unchecked authority. They've couched this authority by describing how they generally expect it to work in a temporary manner, but they've also clearly stated it is open ended and there is no discussion of due process in the A&D phase (again CDC wants your comments on this fact).  To see how CDC's concept of unlimited city wide Apprehension and Detention would play out, watch CDC's very own 2011 propaganda movieContagion. A movie basically written for and by the CDC to scare the public into funding them and showcase how their heroic dream response to an outbreak would unfold.  There is no onus on the CDC to end the Apprehension phase, or to proceed on to issuing orders of isolation, quarantine, or conditional release; As such you (or your city) can be held in apprehension and detention indefinitely.   In Stage 3: IF an order of isolation, quarantine, or conditional release is issued, the CDC gives those so ordered one chance in the first 72 hours to ask CDC to change their minds, after which unlimited detention is again on the table.   The CDC can stop, detain, and jail you anywhere.   The other key factors of note is that the CDC does NOT limit this power to the international borders. CDC says it can take such actions any where in the USA based on a claim that every action affects interstate travel.  CDC claims it can set up check points at any bus or train station in the country, or at any location that might affect interstate travel.  CDC claims that the simple act of lining up at any CDC checkpoint gives them irrevocable authority to force you to be screened. an individual's refusal to be screened may result in quarantine, isolation, or conditional release This could be in your car stuck in traffic at a CDC check point, a bus station, a taxi-stand, etc etc.    (holding that a passenger consents to an airport security search by presenting himself/herself for boarding and that such consent may not be revoked by simply walking away). Thus, in order to protect interstate travel from communicable disease threats, HHS/CDC intends for this section to apply broadly to all circumstances where individuals may queue with other travelers   HHS/CDC believes that the rationale for airport security screenings may be extended to other forms of transportation, e.g., trains and buses, because of the similar administrative or special governmental need in preventing interstate communicable disease spread  FORCED VACCINATION   CDC may enter into an agreement with an individual, upon such terms as the CDC considers to be reasonably necessary, indicating that the individual consents to any of the public health measures authorized under this part, including quarantine, isolation, conditional release, medical examination, hospitalization, vaccination, and treatment; provided that the individual's consent shall not be considered as a prerequisite to any exercise of any authority under this part. Even though the CDC believes it can force all the above procedures on individuals and groups, it also uses voluntary agreements for the sole purpose of making forced actions easier to perform. Anyone breaking these voluntary agreements, even if they didn't agree to them, is subject to criminal prosecution.  individuals who violate the terms of the agreement or the terms of the Federal order for quarantine, isolation, or conditional release (even if no agreement is in place between the individual and the government), he or she may be subject to criminal penalties Surprisingly, the one thing CDC's left out of this rule making is the creation of the their own armed Federal Police Force to carry out these action; but it can't be far off. This is simple:  If any agency of any government tries to stop innocent, healthy people, without cause, without warrant and without charge, then tries to detain, quarantine or imprison you,  then what they are doing is unlawful denial of Constitutional rights and you have just grounds to SHOOT THEM.  If you choose to shoot, make certain you SHOOT FIRST and SHOOT TO KILL."	Fake

Some claim he is a Muslim, a terrorist or a Russian spy. However, what is known beyond any reasonable doubt is that he is largely incompetent and has little love for America. Proof of this can be found by looking no further that the White House logo, which was redesigned in 2016. Everyone known what the White House logo is supposed to look like  a portrait of the North Face of the White House  but what few people have noticed over the past few years was the change at the top of the logo. For many years, the White House logo had the American flag flying on the top of the White House  as it does in real life. In Obamas redesigned version, there is no American flag, just a white flag. Here is what the original logo looked like:  And here is Obamas sanitized version:  The white flag is a common symbol for surrender, which has many people wondering if Obama was trying to secretly signal to Americas enemies that he was surrendering. In all seriousness, this probably wasnt some secret signal. It was just Obama disrespecting America and trying to get rid of anything that made us special  which really shouldnt surprise anyone at this point. Obama has disgraced the American flag multiple times while in office, so it should be no surprise that he would completely remove it from the White House logo. Weve suffered for almost eight years under a president who has made it clear he doesnt think America is special. We desperately need to elect someone who will restore our faith in our country and put America, and Americans, first. H/T WZ"	Fake

The FBI Director's announcement that the Bureau had found more emails pertinent to its Hillary Clinton private e-mail server investigation, and was re-opening that investigation, sent shockwaves across the political spectrum this afternoon.   The fact that the FBI made such an announcement is extraordinary in itself.  Generally, the Bureau does NOT publicly reveal that someone is under investigation, never mind someone who is so high-profile, like an active candidate for President!  So the revelation that the Hillary investigation is now re-opened is an absolute stunner on many levels.  Frankly, all experts agree that it must be something extraordinary they found; something likely criminal. Adding to the drama was that the FBI Director did NOT coordinate the announcement with the White House or with the Department of Justice (DOJ) - which could be an effort by the Bureau to regain its lost reputation for Integrity.  Keeping the White house and Justice Department out of the loop means they could not interfere prior to the announcement, and now that the announcement has been made publicly, neither the White House nor the DOJ can prevent the public from knowing something big is taking place. DEVASTATING REVELATIONS  And big might be an understatement.  Late Friday night, the White House very quietly CANCELED all of Barack Obama's scheduled campaign appearances on behalf of Hillary Clinton!  The scheduled events, confirmed for months, were all quietly DELETED.  See the Before and After images below: Whatever information the FBI has found must be completely devastating for Clinton.

Veterans cannot make appointments, the cost for treatment is outrageous, over 307,000 veterans died  waiting for care, yet nobody has been held accountable. The most recent atrocity by the VA came when the VA went to Congress, less than three months before the end of the fiscal year,  short $2.6 billion in funds in order to care for the veterans.  The Secretary of Veteran Affairs, Robert McDonald, told Congress that if they do not receive $2.6 billion more in funds, they will have to deny veterans the care they deserve. The VA has  been known to delay doctor appointments, especially in the past 7 years. Robert McDonald has only been Secretary of Veteran Affairs for the past year, yet he has already made some  horrific things. What youre seeing is a sea of change in the way VA operates. Historically, weve managed to a budget instead of managing to requirements based on veterans needs.  After discussing the possibility of closing some of the VA hospitals, Congress passed an emergency spending bill worth $3.5 billion. Josh Earnest, White House spokesman, said that the  United States has committed to spend $4.5 billion in order to help rebuild Syria while also addressing the refugee camps scattered throughout Europe. $419 million will be designated for  humanitarian aid assisting with Syrian refugees.

" California Introduces Law To Jail Anyone Who Questions Man-Made Climate Change: First Amendment Now Dead http://www.redflagnews.com/headlines-2016/california-introduces-law-to-jail-anyone-who-questions-man-made-climate-change-first-amendment-now-dead A landmark bill allowing for the prosecution of climate change dissent effectively died Thursday after the California Senate failed to take it up before the deadline.  Senate Bill 1161, or the California Climate Science Truth and Accountability Act of 2016, would have authorized prosecutors to sue fossil fuel companies, think tanks and others that have  deceived or misled the public on the risks of climate change.  The measure, which cleared two Senate committees, provided a four-year window in the statute of limitations on violations of the states Unfair Competition Law, allowing legal action to be  brought until Jan. 1 on charges of climate change fraud extending back indefinitely.  This bill explicitly authorizes district attorneys and the Attorney General to pursue UCL claims alleging that a business or organization has directly or indirectly engaged in unfair  competition with respect to scientific evidence regarding the existence, extent, or current or future impacts of anthropogenic induced climate change, said the state Senate Rules  Committees floor analysis of the bill.  Leading the fight against the measure was the Civil Justice Association of California, joined by pro-business groups such as the California Chamber of Commerce and the California Business  Roundtable.  Justice association President Kim Stone said she was pleased that the state Senate realized this bill was extreme.  Our concern about the bill is that by eliminating the statute of limitations and reviving claims from forever in the past, its fundamentally unfair, said Ms. Stone.  The statute of limitations under the Unfair Competition Law is now four years. As originally introduced, the bill would have allowed climate fraud lawsuits extending back 30 years, but  later was amended to provide no time limit, she said.  This bill would be as if the IRS now said that we could audit you for the first year you filed your taxes, or your parents taxes, or even for your grandparents taxes. Would you have the  documentation required to defend yourself if you were accused of having done something wrong? Ms. Stone said. No, nobody would have saved their papers because everyone knows the IRS has  three years to audit you.  The measure was introduced amid a national push by Democrats and activist groups to use the legal system to prosecute climate change fraud, prompting a backlash from skeptics who have  denounced the campaign as an assault on free speech.  A coalition of 17 state attorneys general, including California Attorney General Kamala Harris, have joined forces to pursue climate change skeptics. At least four prosecutors reportedly  have launched investigations into Exxon Mobil for climate change fraud.  Introduced by state Sen. Ben Allen, Santa Monica Democrat, S.B. 1161 had strong support from environmental groups, led by the Union of Concerned Scientists.  The group, which had no immediate comment on the bills failure, had argued that the measure was needed to challenge efforts to confuse consumers and fend off competition from lower-carbon  energy sources.  To be clear, S.B. 1161 does not presume that any fossil fuel company has violated the law. But should the evidence support legal action, S.B. 1161 will give public prosecutors a more  powerful tool to pursue it, Jason Barbose, Western states policy manager of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said in a May 16 post.  It would be an unfortunate contortion of our justice system for a fossil fuel company to escape prosecution for unlawful acts simply because it successfully hid the evidence from public  view. S.B. 1161 protects the public from such a risk, he said."	Fake
" Wikileaks Massive Exposure: Here Are 6 Republicans Who Took Bribes From Clinton To Destroy Trump http://americanprides.com/2017/08/24/wikileaks-massive-exposure-here-are-6-republicans-who-took-bribes-from-clinton-to-destroy-trump/ Hillary Clinton is still whining about her humiliating loss to President Donald Trump in last years election. She plans to take him down and her plan involves some powerful Republicans. Wikileaks named Paul Ryan, Carly Fiorina, John Kasich, Jeb Bush, Lindsey Graham, and John McCain as Republicans who were paid off by Clinton to ensure that Donald Trump lost the election, or undermine him if he won as reported by Conservative Daily Post. Her evil plot was revealed in an email sent last July from Clintons campaign manager John Podesta to top aide Huma Abedin. Podesta detailed how the funds were being redirected from Clintons campaign to the Super PACs of Carly Fiorina, John Kasich, and Jeb Bush. JB, CF, and JK PACS will be noticeably silent for the rest of the campaign. The email continued, Each will receive a significant allowance from advertising budget. HRC is in the loop and has talked to all three personally. Eyes only. As revealed in other emails, several members of the Republican Party were bought off in order to push the Clinton agenda forward. Only one day before Speaker of the House Paul Ryan retracted Donald Trumps invitation to speak at an event in Wisconsin, an email was sent out that could be to blame. It read, He is on board, will retract the invitation to speak. Eyes only. Other Clinton emails imply that money is being moved to Republican elected officials in the House and Senate. For example, right after John McCain attacked President Trump by publicly criticizing him, FEC records show that two large donations from PACS and private sources went to the senator immediately after."

At this point, its not speculation. Its not conjecture. Its a certainty. The only variable is when  especially after her housekeeper was found dead. As Fox News revealed this morning, Rices housekeeper was interviewed by the FBI and spilled the beans about numerous private conversations she overheard between Rice, members of the Obama administration, Hillary Clinton, and even the former President himself. FBI agents were seen approaching the home of Maria de la Juerta Gomez on Monday, where they stayed for a good two or more hours. According to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Gomez was able to provide plenty of information to aid in the investigation into Rices abuse of her power in the Obama administration to unmask of people associated with Donald Trump in an effort to swing the election in favor of a certain crooked opponent of his. On Tuesday evening, Gomezs lifeless body was found floating in Lake Hope, just outside of her hometown of Ithica, Connecticut. Police officers took some time to identify the body because her finger tips had been severed and no family was immediately able to identify her, but her identity was determined via dental records from Dr. Michael Armstrong, DDS. There are currently no suspects in the murder, but Police Captain Ari Reynolds says that they are pursuing this case with the appropriate amount of manpower. When the murderer is caught, he or she will talk. They will have no choice."	Fake

" BUSTED! Hillarys Million Dollar Scandal With Russia Definitively UNCOVERED! http://www.voxtribune.com/busted-hillarys-million-dollar-scandal-russia-definitively-uncovered/ Hillary used her foundation to do business Russia, and this time Peter Schweizer has the details about Hillarys $145 million scandal.  She got money from Saudi Arabia as well, but lets focus on Russia now:  According to Breitbart:  Tuesday on Fox Business Network, Lou Dobbs Tonight, Breitbart editor at large and the author of  Clinton Cash, Peter Schweizer said there needs to be a federal investigation into the Russian uranium deal then-Secretary of State Hillary Clintons State Department approved after the Clinton Foundation receiving $145 million from the shareholders of Uranium One.  Discussing Clintons speech on foreign political donations, Schweizer said, It was a bizarre speech that she gave. Its as if she was Rip Van Winkle has been asleep since the Clinton Foundation, Clinton Global Initiative had been functioning. If we are concerned about foreign government money in our politics as Hillary Clinton says she is lets begin with the Clinton Foundation and begin with a very basic simple premise that is the Clinton Foundation agreed, signed an agreement with Barack Obama that they would disclose all of their donors on an annual basis.  Under oath Hillary Clinton told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee the same thing and we know they havent done it, that there are at least 1,100 foreign donations that they have any been disclosed to the American public. I was just shaking my head throughout that speech. It was. remarkable for her to say that.  Discussing the Clinton Foundation receiving $145 million from the shareholders of Uranium One, he continued, Look there are couple of things that are extremely troubling about the deal we touched on. number one is the amount of money $145 million. We are not talking about a super PAC giving a million dollars to support a candidate. We are not talking about campaign donations. We are talking about $145 million which by the way is 75 percent or more of the annual budget of the Clinton Foundation itself so its a huge sum of money. Second of all we are talking about a fundamental issue of national security which is uranium  its not like oil and gas that you can find all sorts of places.  There are precious few places you can mine for uranium, in the United States is one of those areas. And number three we are talking about the Russian government. A lot of people dont realize it now, in parts of the Midwest American soil is owned by Vladimir Putins government because this deal went through.  And in addition to the $145 million Bill Clinton got half a billion dollars, $500,000 for a 20-minute speech from a Russian investment bank tied to the Kremlin, two months before the State Department signed off on this deal. It just stinks to high heaven and I think it requires a major investigation by the federal government.  He added, Everyone knows the reason that money flows to politicians is people want something in return. And particularly when you are talking about overseas in places like Nigeria or Russia or the United Arab Emirates. Those political cultures are rife with pay off and corruption.  And to think that you have got a Nigerian businessmen pledging $1 billion with a B to the Clinton Global Initiative that he wants nothing from the Clinton in return is just laughable. I think the American people recognize that there is a pay to play  system in Washington and thats why you are seeing this rebellion against money in politics.  CROOKED Hillary Clinton never made a clean deal.  Thank God, we the people elected Trump. SHARE to EXPOSE Her ONCE AGAIN!"	Fake

Apparently, Malias weed habit has gotten worse because she was just caught in a massive marijuana bust in her home city of Chicago, Illinois.  Malia was caught buying weed edibles from two of her thug friends as well as enough pot to make thug rapper Snoop Dogg look like an amateur, according to sources within Chicagos elite Drug Task Force.  Officers first observed Obama pulling up to a street corner and blinking her lights six times, a spokesman for the department says. She then spoke with an African-American male, who got into her car. Then they drove to a building a few blocks over.  She walked upstairs with the man then came back down 30 minutes later, the spokesman says. It was then that officers made their move.   Obama was then swarmed by police, who easily found her precious drugs in her oversized Gucci handbag. The bust included six cans of Baked Soda, thirteen THC-infused lollipops, and a gram shy of 6 pounds of pot. The classy former First Daughter reportedly broke down crying, angrily demanding that she be allowed to call her dad. Unfortunately for her, she had to wait until she was booked because her phone was entered into evidence.  If you think she might get special treatment because of who her father is, you forgot how much cops in Chicago hate him. She faces up to six years in prison from the drugs alone.

" CNN Admits They Spread Fake News  Forced To APOLOGIZE http://xbn-news.com/index.php/2017/06/27/cnn-admits-spread-fake-news-forced-apologize/ CNN has spent the last few months blatantly spreading fake news about Donald Trump in the hopes of taking him down. Despite this, CNN has always claimed to be unbiased and has denied spinning fake news against Trump in any way.  Now, however, CNN has finally been forced to admit that they are spreading fake news about the president.  Conservative Fighters reported that CNN was forced to issue an apology after spreading fake news as they tried to connect some Trump associates to Russia. When it was confirmed that the story was indeed fake, CNN had to issue an apology with their tails between their legs.  On June 22, 2017, CNN.com published a story connecting Anthony Scaramucci with investigations into the Russian Direct Investment Fund, CNN said in their retraction. That story did not meet CNNs editorial standards and has been retracted. Links to the story have been disabled. CNN apologizes to Mr. Scaramucci.  CNN also removed the original report from their website in the hopes that people wont be able to see how far they go in their quest to spread lies. Heres that full report from CNN:  Senate investigators are examining the activities of a little-known $10-billion Russian investment fund whose chief executive met with a member of President Donald Trumps transition team four days before Trumps inauguration, a congressional source told CNN.  The source said the Senate intelligence committee is investigating the Russian fund in connection with its examination of discussions between White House adviser Jared Kushner and the head of a prominent Russian bank. The bank, Vnesheconombank, or VEB, oversees the fund, which has ties to several Trump advisers. Both the bank and the fund have been covered since 2014 by sanctions restricting U.S. business dealings.  Separately, the Treasury Department has been looking into the Jan. 16 meeting between the funds chief executive and Anthony Scaramucci, a member of the transition teams executive committee and a fundraiser and adviser for Trumps presidential campaign, according to a Jan. 30 letter from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  Two Democratic senators asked Treasury to investigate whether Scaramucci promised to lift sanctions  a policy shift that would help the fund attract more international investment to Russia.  The inquiries draw attention to the Russian Direct Investment Fund, a government investment arm that has helped top U.S. private-equity firms invest in Russia and that was advised by Stephen Schwarzman, who is now chairman of Trumps Strategic and Policy Forum, an advisory group of business leaders.  Schwarzman, chief executive officer of Blackstone Group, was named in 2011 to the funds International Advisory Board along with other leaders of major equity companies and sovereigh-wealth funds who reviewed the funds operations, plans and potential investments. Schwarzman declined to comment. A source close to him said Schwarzman has not spoken to anyone on the fund for some time.  The fund also worked with Goldman Sachs, whose former president Gary Cohn is Trumps chief economic adviser and where Kirill Dmitriev, the funds chief executive, worked as an investment banker in the 1990s. Goldman was part of a consortium created in 2012 to invest in large Russian businesses preparing to go public, and was hired in 2013 to burnish Russias investment image. The company declined to comment.  Senate and House investigators are looking into various Russian entities to determine whether anyone connected to the Trump campaign helped Russians as they meddled in the 2016 presidential election, and whether Trump associates discussed sanctions with Russian officials.  The congressional inquiries, along with a criminal investigation by special counsel Robert S. Mueller, have shadowed the Trump administration. Trump has denied any connection to Russias election-meddling, calling the criminal probe a witch hunt.  Scaramucci, a billionaire founder of SkyBridge Capital, minimized his January meeting with Dmitriev in the resort town of Davos, Switzerland, at the celebrated annual gathering of the World Economic Forum. Scaramucci had met Dmitriev at previous Davos meetings, although at the gathering in January, Scaramucci was expecting to be named White House liaison to the business community.  Dmitriev came over to say hello in a restaurant, and I was cordial, Scaramucci said in a recent email to CNN. There is nothing there.  The day after the meeting, Scaramucci told Bloomberg TV that he had as a private citizen been working with Dmitriev on bringing a delegation of executives to Russia.  What I said to him last night, in my capacity inside the administration, I would certainly reach out to some people to help him, Scaramucci said before describing a thicket of ethical clearances he would face. The idea was many months ago to have more outreach with Russia but also other countries, not just Russia. China, other countries.  Scaramuccis comments alarmed Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Ben Cardin of Maryland, who asked Mnuchin investigate whether Scaramucci sought to facilitate prohibited transactions or promised to waive or lift sanctions against Russia.  In a reply Jan. 30, before he was sworn in, Mnuchin said he would ensure the appropriate Department components assess whether further investigation of this matter is warranted. The Treasury Department did not respond to CNN requests for an update.  A spokeswoman for the Russian fund said the two men did not discuss sanctions, and that the discussion itself did not violate sanctions that U.S. imposed in 2014 after Russia annexed part of neighboring Ukraine. The spokeswoman declined to describe the conversation, saying, We do not comment on private meetings.  Since Trumps election, Dmitriev has been one of Russias most vocal officials in calling for an end to U.S. sanctions and arguing that joint U.S.-Russia projects can create jobs in the United States.  The fund hired two U.S. lobbying firms in September 2014, after sanctions were imposed, paying them a combined $150,000 over two months for public relations work. The fund has not hired any lobbyists since then.  With a history of helping U.S. manufacturers and asset management companies invest in Russia. The fund is a logical starting point for Russias push to lift U.S. sanctions, former State Department chief economist Rodney Ludema said.  If youre going to get your nose under the tent, thats a good place to start, said Ludema, a Georgetown University economics professor. Im sure their objective is to get rid of all the sanctions against the financial institutions. But RDIF is one [sanctioned organizations] where a number of prominent U.S. investors have been involved.  Scaramucci also questioned U.S. sanctions while he was in Davos and echoed Trumps statements about improving relations with Russia.  Two weeks after the meeting between Scaramucci and Dmitriev, when President Trump spoke by phone to Russian President Vladimir Putin, the fund announced it would open an office in New York in May.  No New York office has been opened but the fund still expects to open a representative office in the US this year, the spokeswoman said.

" MEXICAN PRESIDENT: WE AGREE TO PAY FOR THE WALL IF THE DEAL INCLUDES RETURNING TEXAS TO MEXICO http://xbn-news.com/index.php/2017/07/16/mexican-president-agree-pay-wall-deal-includes-returning-texas-mexico/ U.S. President Donald Trump said he had a friendly phone call with Mexicos president on Friday but asserted he will renegotiate trade deals and other aspects of the countries ties because Mexico has beat us to a pulp in the past. Mexicos peso extended gains on news of the call. The two men spoke for about an hour on Friday, a day after President Enrique Pena Nieto scrapped a planned meeting in Washington next week over Trumps insistence that Mexico pay for a multibillion-dollar border wall. It was a very, very friendly call, Trump told a joint news conference with visiting British Prime Minister Theresa May.  Similarly, President Nieto conveyed a similar message in his interview with El Universal, the largest news agency in Mexico City. I can tell you I am happy with what was said and what was agreed upon, the president revealed. I am convinced that we can have a friendly, respectful relationship with the United States as well as with President Trump. Asked to elaborate on the topics mentioned during the hour-long telephone call, President Nieto said that he was not at liberty to disclose that, but did mention there was talk about the wall between the two countries, as well as a possible deal that might be struck in the future.  I was very blunt and open with him, since I dont believe him to be a man who cares much about pleasantries or protocol, the Mexican president said. I told him Mexico would agree to pay for the wall only under the condition that our country and the Mexican people be compensated for it in some other way. While we were talking, the though came to me that perhaps I could ask him to have his engineers design the wall so that it puts Texas in Mexican territory; in other words, to build the wall so that it excludes Texas from the United States. I though that would be fair, since we would be paying for the construction.  He added, I could tell he didnt like the idea, but to be fair  he did say he would think about it. And if you think about it rationally, youll arrive at the conclusion that its a somewhat fair trade-off. Sure, on one hand our national budget would be nearly depleted, since the initial cost of construction is still only based on loose estimates. However, getting Texas back after all this time would be a huge victory for Mexico.  I have to add that I still havent figured out what we would do with the conservative, inbred rednecks that reside there at the moment, but Im sure wed be able to come to some sort of an arrangement. At the end of the day, we all know how huge a fan Donald Trump is of deporting people. Maybe he deserves a chance to have his campaign-long wish come true in the form of organizing the deportation of Texans to other U.S. states so that we can finally have our land back as empty and unspoiled as we left it, Nieto concluded."

They are among a class that this would be prohibited. It would cripple agriculture if they didnt have the people coming in to do this work,  She went on to argue that Americans just arent interested in working in 100-degree temperatures. So you would have a severe crippling of the largest ag industry in America, she concluded.  The Trump administration worked with Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and David Perdue of Georgia to produce a bill that could halve the number of people legally accepted into the country over the next ten years, according to The Hill.  Feinstein isnt the first senator to use that same line of attack against the bill known as the RAISE Act. GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham announced he opposed the act due to its potential effects on agriculture in his home state.  South Carolinas number one industry is agriculture and tourism is number two, the senator said in an official statement. If this proposal were to become law, it would be devastating to our states economy which relies on this immigrant workforce.  The act under consideration would only affect green card holders, a program that agriculture doesnt rely on to find foreign workers. Instead, the industry largely finds labor through the H-2 work Visa program, something that isnt even addressed in the RAISE Act.

" George Soros Furious After Cops Shut Down Lethal Trap He Set For Trump Supporters In Arizona http://www.nationalinsiderpolitics.com/2017/08/25/george-soros-furious-cops-shut-lethal-trap-set-trump-supporters-arizona/ The bad news is nobody lives forever.  The good news is Hungarian-born globalist tyrant George Soros is 87.  Soros, the silver-spooned destroyer of Western nations, has been on a tear lately, spending his billions on pet social engineering projects such as the EU migrant crisis and funding meddlesome Non-Goverment Organizations (NGOs) and various color revolutions around the world.  There have been unofficial reports that Soros money bank-rolled leftist opponents of the Charlottesville rally that left three people dead and dozens injured, as well as other protests against racist Confederate statues and monuments.  Thankfully, Deep Pockets George Soros has only a few more miles to go before he sleeps. Although until the world is finally rid of this miserable New World Order communist, humanity will have to swallow the bitter fruits of his vast riches.  The Daily Caller reports that leading anti-Trump activists backed by major Democratic donors, including George Soros, mobilized large numbers of protesters ahead of President Trumps rally in Phoenix on Tuesday, with the intention of stealing the spotlight from the presidents event.  A group that calls itself Indivisible reportedly is leading the resistance and encouraging protesters to register for tickets for the rally itself.  Phoenix is shaping up to become Trumps Maidan moment. Only instead of Soros-funded Ukrainian Nazis fomenting bloody political unrest, it was Soros-funded leftist goon squads crashing in on Trumps party on Tuesday.  Luckily, police knew about the impending chaos and were stationed around the city to protect the people from Soros lethal plot.  How and when will the Soros meddling end?  The day the Grim Reaper comes to usher the atheist puppet master on down to that eternally warm place below.  Do you think President Trump should use all means of international law to put a stop to the social engineering experiments of George Soros?

" Obama Stole The PresidencyNew Report Shows Millions Of Illegals Flipped The 2008 Election http://americanprides.com/2017/08/29/obama-stole-the-presidency-new-report-shows-millions-of-illegals-flipped-the-2008-election/http://www.snopes.com/illegal-immigrants-2008-election/ Democrats should be careful, because the shaky foundation beneath their feet is falling apart. The Left has spent years painting conservatives as paranoid conspiracy theorists who complain about voter fraud instead of focusing on the real issues. That is why, according to the Left, conservatives lose elections. But what happens when the truth comes out, and conservatives were right the whole time? Does the Left then start to get paranoid? We should know the answers to these questions at some point in the near future, because the truth is indeed starting to come out. As reported by The Washington Times: A research group in New Jersey has taken a fresh look at postelection polling data and concluded that the number of noncitizens voting illegally in U.S. elections is likely far greater than previous estimates. As many as 5.7 million noncitizens may have voted in the 2008 election, which put Barack Obama in the White House. The research organization Just Facts, a widely cited, independent think tank led by self-described conservatives and libertarians, revealed its number-crunching in a report on national immigration. Just Facts President James D. Agresti and his team looked at data from an extensive Harvard/YouGov study that every two years questions a sample size of tens of thousands of voters. Some acknowledge they are noncitizens and are thus ineligible to vote. There you have it: conservatives were right about voter fraud. When President Trump stated that he would have won the popular vote in addition to the Electoral College had no illegals voted in the 2016 election, liberals openly mocked him. As stated before, anyone who agreed with Trump was a loony conspiracy theorist. It did not take much to realize, however, that liberals had no actual response to these claims. They refuted the Presidents argument only by calling him a sore loser. They did not, on the other hand, actually prove him wrong. As it turns out, liberals did not prove Trump wrong because he simply was not wrong in the first place. A fresh batch of studies confirm that millions of illegals may have voted for Hillary Clinton as well. What do you think, America? Should liberals be held accountable now that Americans have the proof? Is this a matter for the Justice Department, or should Democrats just pay for it at the polls? Let us know your thoughts below!"

" KABOOM  White House Exposes McCain As A TRAITORHis Career Just Went Up In SMOKE! http://www.nationalinsiderpolitics.com/2017/08/17/kaboom-white-house-exposes-mccain-traitorhis-career-just-went-smoke/ One of the more disturbing aspects of the current political landscape isnt the Democrat criticism of President Trump. That is to be expected.  Itd be better if at least some of that criticism was valid and well thought-out, as opposed to the insane rantings of lunatics like Trump-hasnt-created jobs Nancy Pelosi and Trump-needs-to-be-impeached Maxine Waters.  All criticism aside, there are worse things circulating in the political environment.  Im referring to the subterfuge some within President Trumps own party are using in what appears to be an attempt to undermine him and his agenda.  While there are many candidates for such suspicions within the Republican Party, Senator John McCain would be near the top of the list. This is especially distressing given his military service; he SHOULD be able to practice a bit more loyalty to his chief.  Rather than showing loyalty to President Trump, Mr. McCain seems to enjoy employing subterfuge to undermine the presidents agenda.  Valid differences on policies are fine, but attempts to take down the president are not. As has been pointed out here before, Mr. McCain has some skeletons in his closet, and is clearly someone who should have retired from the Senate years ago.  Via the True Pundit:  McCain is believed to have somehow gained access to the content of President Donald Trumps private, classified telephone calls with world leaders. And he isnt keeping quiet about what was talked about either.  An analysis of McCains recent public statements by White House officials, coupled with information from intelligence personnel working with the Trump administration, paints a disturbing picture for McCain  or any elected U.S. politician.  Officials believe the senator has inside knowledge of a number of President Trumps telephone conversations, including at least one conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.  Here we have the popular Trump-Putin topic, as though there is something inherently nefarious about world leaders speaking to each other.  Even more alarming, officials believe McCain is secretly sharing this sensitive information with colleagues and his cabal of friendly mainstream media journalists in a dangerous clandestine campaign to damage Trumps presidency even before it has a chance to succeed.  Oh GREAT.  Given Mr. McCains bellicose talk, perhaps he would be happier if President Trump and President Putin were lobbing nuclear missiles at each other.  In any event, a man who should know something about loyalty, doesnt. Every time we turn around, McCain seems embroiled in something shadowy  How difficult would it be to dethrone McCain from his Senate chairmanship? At least that would be a good start on correcting his problem."	Fake
" JUST IN: Obama Connected With The Person Who Organized The Charlottesville Riot! http://www.nationalinsiderpolitics.com/2017/08/16/just-obama-connected-person-organized-charlottesville-riot/ White supremacists do not accept any other race that is considered to be outside of Europe, so a white supremacist supporting a black President is a rare sight.  So if I were to tell you that one of these so called white is right folks were actually an Obama supporter, you might want to know what was up with that. After all, its highly unlikely that a person could go from avid Obama supporter to neo-Nazi over the course of a year. Especially if that person were a die hard liberal. However, they might want to make that swing if there were a specific reason that it would help the liberal agenda (their true love) for white people in general and Trump supporters, in particular, look really bad.  Of course, we know that liberals would never use underhanded methods to make themselves look better. However, theyre not looking too great after this news about the instigator of the recent Charlottesville riots came out. It would be bad enough if these were just well meaning but misguided whities who thought they were doing the world a favor by flaunting their ignorance but now the media has come out STRONG taking every opportunity to say that these modern day KKK members and neo-Nazis are basically President Trumps best friends, despite what he has to say about it. Now it looks like the whole thing was a surgical political strike, played out before our eyes.  Via DC Whispers  Well this is fishy. His name is Jason Kessler. He is the one cited as the organizer of the now infamous Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. The thing is, Mr. Kesslers arrival on the alt right and/or White Nationalist scene didnt occur until November 2016.  Thats right  Kessler didnt start his white nationalist activism until after Donald Trump won the White House. Prior to that it appears he participated in the far left/socialist Occupy Wall Street movement as noted by the far-left, George Soros-funded Southern Poverty Law Center  Rumors abound on white nationalist forums that Kesslers ideological pedigree before 2016 was less than pure and seem to point to involvement in the Occupy movement and past support for President Obama.  At one recent speech in favor of Charlottesvilles status as a sanctuary city, Kessler live-streamed himself as an attendee questioned him and apologized for an undisclosed spat during Kesslers apparent involvement with Occupy. Kessler appeared visibly perturbed by the womans presence and reminders of their past association.  It also appears Mr. Kessler was actually a CNN on site correspondent during the Occupy protests: (these are being archived as it appears CNN is attempting to scrub its former affiliation with Mr. Kessler:)  Well isnt that curious? Theres no doubt that what happened over the weekend was a lethal cocktail of smart and stupid with a heaping helping of biased media coverage thrown in, just to make it go down smooth. The twist in the plot is that the smart (liberals) were playing the stupid (neo-nazis and ANTIFA alike) in order to further their own agenda. This wasnt random, it wasnt just chance that these two sides clashed in an epic way that would grab the attention of the entire nation.  The left has worked their tails off to make Americans believe that President Trump is a racist based seemingly just on the fact that hes not a minority. There are a couple of distinctions that are worth making though. For one thing, there is a huge difference between President Trump supporting the KKK and the KKK supporting Trump. We can control who we support but we cant choose who supports us. The President spoke out against violence on every possible front, but since he didnt actually bash all white people, apparently hes part of the white supremacist movement according to the left  So lets assume that these Nazi wannabes are die hard Trump supporters; if thats the case they feel that way just because hes white. You know, kind of like black American supported Obama just because he was black. Nobody thought it was a problem when black people were proud to have someone of African descent in the White House. Double standard much? But for the record, the President still isnt claiming these jerks, hes just not ready to diss an entire race (his own race) because of the stupid actions of a few.  There is one other possibility as to what could be behind this former Obama supporter marching with the white makes right folks. Maybe Kessler really was a hard core Obama supporter and he was truly a supporter of neutrality. But lets face it, 8 years of dealing with the Obamas could make anyone swear off an entire race. They say that once you go black you dont go back, but it looks like Kessler proved that wrong. Either that or hes a liberal double agent. You decide.  Whar do you think of this? Share your opinion!"

" You Will Be Shocked When You Learn What Planned Parenthood Wants To Teach Preschoolers About Sex http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/you-will-be-shocked-when-you-learn-what-planned-parenthood-wants-to-teach-preschoolers-about-sex  What should we teach children that are three and four years old about sex? If you said nothing in response to that question, that was the right answer. Exposing very young children to graphic material about human sexuality at a very early age can be extremely detrimental, but that is precisely what Planned Parenthood wants to do. And I am not just talking about run of the mill sexual education. Planned Parenthood has just released new guidelines for educating preschoolers that include entire sections about transgenderism and masturbation. And remember, U.S. taxpayers are paying for all of this, because Planned Parenthood receives about 500 million dollars from the U.S. government every year. The Republicans have control of the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives, and so there is absolutely no excuse for not defunding Planned Parenthood as soon as possible.   When I first learned about these new guidelines, I was absolutely stunned. Little children that are three and four years old are just learning to put sentences together, and yet Planned Parenthood wants them to start learning about sexuality and gender roles at that age? The following comes from Matt Miller  New guidelines have been issued on the Planned Parenthood website containing detailed methods for talking to preschoolers about gender roles, sexuality, masturbation, transgenderism, and even ways of determining whether your child is trans or not. In these new guidelines, there is even a section for parents that are wondering if their little preschooler is transgender. According to Planned Parenthood, parents of a potentially transgender preschooler should let them wear what they want, have the haircut they want, and even use a name that reflects their gender  If you think your child might be transgender but dont know what to do, talking with a counselor or therapist whos familiar and supportive of LGBTQ identities is a good idea. Talking with other families with trans or gender nonconforming kids can be helpful, too  for both you and your child. There are community groups like PFLAG which may be in your area, and there are also lots of parenting groups online.  Its also a good idea to talk to your child directly about their gender if you think they might be transgender or gender expansive. Ask them if theyre a boy or a girl, and how they know that to be true. If they are transgender, giving them the power to wear what they want, have the haircut they want, and even use a name that reflects their gender are all going to be really important for them to feel safe, especially once they start going to school. For help talking to your child about this stuff, Gender Spectrum is a good place to start. This is wrong on so many levels, but if you speak out against these things you might be the one that is branded as a criminal.  In fact, a new law that is moving through the California legislature is so bizarre that it is hard to believe that it is actually real. If you do not use the proper pronoun for transgender senior citizens in California, you could soon be slapped with a huge fine or even be sent to prison. The following comes from Charisma News  California is on its way to passing a new law that makes it illegal to call transgender senior citizens a pronoun they dont like. For example, if an elderly person who was born male and lives in a long-term care facility wishes to be called her or she, the workers there had better do it or face the consequences. The proposed law would even apply to Christian facilities.  SB 219, titled the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Long-Term Care Facility Residents Bill of Rights, states, It shall be unlawful for a long-term care facility or facility staff to.  willfully and repeatedly fail to use a residents preferred name or pronouns after being clearly informed of the preferred name or pronouns. It imposes fines and jail time on any long-term care employee who refuses to use transgender pronouns. Fines for repeat offenders could be as high as $1,000 and a jail term of up to a year. Regardless of what you believe, this is supposed to be a nation that protects free speech.  If you want to stand up against this sort of tyranny, I would encourage you to support my campaign by visiting HelpMichaelWin.com. If I am elected, I promise to fight these kinds of laws as hard as I can.  Already, it is getting to the point where those that believe in traditional values will no longer be able to participate in the wedding industry. For example, a bridal shop in Pennsylvania has been forced to temporarily close its doors because it wouldnt participate in a gay wedding  A Christian-owned bridal shop in Pennsylvania has temporarily closed its doors to the public and is now only accepting appointments after its owner received threats because the shop refused to serve a lesbian couple looking for a wedding dress, a source close to the situation told The Christian Post. This case got national attention, but the owners of the bridal shop have no intention of caving in  The owners of W.W. Bridal Boutique reserve the rights afforded to them by the First Amendment of the Constitution to live out our lives according to our faith, the W.W. Bridal post was quoted as stating. We will continue to serve our customers based on the tenets of our faith.  Following the PGN report, nationally recognized left-leaning outlets such as the Huffington Post and Yahoo Style picked up on the article. The shops co-owner, Victoria Miller, told the Huffington Post in an email that their refusal was based on a matter of religious beliefs. Sadly, small businesses such as this one are being slapped with lawsuits all over the nation for not participating in gay weddings, and many small businesses have already been financially ruined by such lawsuits.  If we do not stand up against the forces of political correctness and fight for freedom of speech and freedom of religion, our rights will continually be eroded until they are almost entirely gone.  This is a critical moment in our history, and if we lose this fight the future of our nation will be very bleak indeed.

" We Need To Build Trumps Wall, And We Need To Build It Tall And Strong http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/we-need-to-build-trumps-wall-and-we-need-to-build-it-tall-and-strong  Did you know that Mexico is the second deadliest nation on the entire planet? The drug war down there continues to spiral completely out of control, and often the violence spills over to our own side of the border. Thanks to President Trump, security along the border is improving, but we still have a long, long way to go. Ultimately what we need is a physical barrier, because large numbers of illegal immigrants continue to pour through the soft spots in our border security. I know that a lot of liberals dont like the idea of a wall, but that is the only way that we are going to make sure that everyone comes into this country through the front door.    The United States is a nation of immigrants, and we will always need a certain level of immigration from other nations. But prior to the Trump administration, our approach to immigration policy was absolutely insane. We had made the legal immigration process an extremely costly and complicated nightmare that hardly anyone could understand or navigate, and yet we had kept the back door completely wide open for drug dealers, gang members, terrorists, sexual predators and anyone that just wanted to take advantage of the system.  We have got to make our legal system of immigration less costly and less complicated, and at the same time we need to slam the back door completely shut so that everyone is forced to come in to the U.S. through the front door.  To illustrate why this is such an incredibly important issue, I would like to share the story of Estefania Soto with you. Thanks to a drunk illegal immigrant, Soto lost her boyfriend and her baby recently in a horrific traffic accident  Estefania Soto has spent her days in various hospital rooms since the crash on June 10. She and her boyfriend, 28-year-old Raul Diaz, Jr., were on a motorcycle on Farm to Market 973 near FM 969 in east Travis County when they were hit head-on by a truck.  The crash killed Diaz and resulted in the premature birth of their child. Soto, 26, was only six months pregnant. Their baby was delivered through a C-section after the crash and passed away shortly after.  Soto has had 15 surgeries over the past month including a leg amputation. If Trumps wall had already been in place, 38-year-old Cesar Corona-Quiterio may have never had the chance to enter this country illegally and Estefania Soto may still be looking forward to a new life with her husband and her baby.  Another tragedy that could have potentially been averted by a wall on the southern border was the brutal rape of a 14-year-old girl at a high school in Rockville, Maryland. The following comes from Fox News  Jose O. Montano, 17, from El Salvador, and Henry E. Sanchez-Milian, 18, from Guatemala, were charged with first-degree rape and two counts of first-degree sexual offense after they allegedly attacked the girl at 9 a.m. last Thursday.  The victim was walking in a school hallway when she met two male students, identified as Montano and Sanchez. Montano asked the victim to walk with him and Sanchez. Montano asked the victim to engage in sexual intercourse. She refused, Montgomery County Police said in a statement.  Montano asked the victim again and then forced her into a boys bathroom and then into a stall. Montano and Sanchez both raped the victim inside the bathroom stall. How would you feel if that was your own daughter?  I dont understand how people can be against the wall. We literally have a war zone on the other side of the border, and CNN has reported that the drug war down in Mexico claimed an astounding 23,000 lives last year  It was the second deadliest conflict in the world last year, but it hardly registered in the international headlines.  As Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan dominated the news agenda, Mexicos drug wars claimed 23,000 lives during 2016  second only to Syria, where 50,000 people died as a result of the civil war. And the rising violence in Mexico and much of the rest of central America has been slowly spreading to communities all across the United States. For example, just check out what has been happening on Long Island  With MS-13 blamed for a trail of 11 corpses of mostly young people found since the start of the school year in Brentwood and Central Islip, the nations focus has turned on how the Central American street gang built such a presence here.  The bloodshed in the two blue-collar towns has gotten the attention of President Donald Trump, who says the killings are the result of lax immigration policies that let too many criminal scum slip through.  Attorney General Jeff Sessions gave a speech Friday not far from a park where the bodies of four young men were found this month bearing MS-13s hallmarks: repeated slashes from a blade that left the victims nearly unrecognizable. Are you starting to understand why I am so adamant about building Trumps wall?  We need to build it high, we need to build it strong, and we need armed guards patrolling every inch of it.  One of the fundamental duties of the federal government is national security, and for decades prior to the Trump administration we had leaders that absolutely refused to secure our borders.  Thankfully, now we have a president that is determined to do something about this national crisis, but we still have a Congress that is intent on blocking him every step of the way.  Every member of Congress that doesnt want Trumps wall needs to go, and they need to be replaced by new blood that is ready to do whatever is necessary in order to protect the American people.

" There Are Population Control Centers All Over America  They Are Called Planned Parenthood Clinics http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/there-are-population-control-centers-all-over-america-they-are-called-planned-parenthood-clinics  The phrase family planning is just a more palatable way of saying population control. In the United States today, Planned Parenthood operates 650 health centers that work tirelessly to promote abortion and other family planning measures. Planned Parenthood says that approximately 2.5 million people visit their health centers each year, and somewhere around 60 million people visit their website. If you are pregnant and you visit one of their clinics, abortion will be pushed very hard. In fact, former Planned Parenthood workers have told us that they actually have abortion sales quotas, and workers that meet those quotas are rewarded with pizza parties and other incentives. Of course making money is one of the primary goals, but Planned Parenthood has also always had a very deep connection to eugenics and population control.  Planned Parenthood was founded by a very strong proponent of eugenics named Margaret Sanger. In her writings she strongly denounced the human weeds and reckless breeders that she felt were bringing unfit children into this world that society would have to care for. And in a 1932 Senate hearing, she advocated a rigid policy of sterilization and segregation for those that were not of the right genetic stock  The main objectives of the[proposed] Population Congress is toapply a stern and rigid policy of sterilization and segregation to that grade of population whose progeny is already tainted, or whose inheritance is such that objectionable traits may be transmitted to offspring. In other words, Sanger believed that some humans are far superior to others, and that everything possible should be done to keep the inferior humans from breeding. In fact, even NPR has admitted that Sanger strongly believed in the eugenics movement  In reading her papers, it is clear Sanger had bought into the movement. She once wrote that consequences of breeding from stock lacking human vitality always will give us social problems and perpetuate institutions of charity and crime. Of course Planned Parenthood continued to have strong ties to the eugenics movement long after Sanger died. In 1969, a plan to reduce U.S. fertility was outlined in a memo that was authored by Planned Parenthood Vice President Frederick Jaffe. The following comes from an article by Ann Olson  In 1969, then Vice President of Planned Parenthood, Frederick Jaffe, sent a memo to the head of the Population Council, Bernard Berelson. It included a table of Proposed Measures to Reduce U.S. Fertility. The Jaffe/Berelson Memo was drawn up by Jaffe as a companion piece to Berelsons paper, Beyond Family Planning published in the Population Councils February 1969 issue of Studies in Family Planning.  This shocking memo makes suggestions for policy changes to be implemented in order to achieve population control:   Restructure family   Postpone or avoid marriage   Alter image of ideal family size   Compulsory education of children   Encourage increased homosexuality   Educate for family limitation   Fertility control agents in water supply   Encourage women to work and provide few child care facilities   Compulsory abortion of out-of-wedlock pregnancies   Compulsory sterilization of all who have two children except for a few who would be allowed three   Confine childbearing to a limited number of adults   Payments to encourage sterilization   Payments to encourage contraception   Payments to encourage abortion   Abortion and sterilization on demand Of course many of the things on that list have actually been implemented since that time.  The dramatic changes that we have seen in America regarding marriage, family and sexuality over the past several decades have not happened by accident. The enemies of our way of life have an agenda, and they have been working tirelessly to carry it out.  Since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973, close to 60 million Americans have been murdered in our countrys abortion mills, and Planned Parenthood has been the biggest offender by far.  According to Planned Parenthoods latest annual report, they performed 328,348 abortions during the year that concluded on September 30th, 2015.  During that same year, Planned Parenthood got 554.6 million dollars from the federal government. That accounts for more than 40 percent of their budget, and it is questionable if Planned Parenthood would be able to continue to exist without all of that funding.  By giving Planned Parenthood more than half a billion dollars a year, the U.S. government is placing a giant stamp of approval on what they are doing. This is a national disgrace, and it must end.  And just like their founder Margaret Sanger, Planned Parenthood seems to place a special emphasis on promoting family planning among minorities. In the United States today, African-American women are more than 5 times as likely to get an abortion as white women are. In 2010, African-American women accounted for approximately 6.6 percent of the U.S. population, but they got 35.7 percent of the abortions.  Planned Parenthood workers commonly stress what a financial burden a new baby will be to poor and minority women, and they are able to convince many of them that murdering their own children is the right thing to do.  When you go to a Planned Parenthood clinic, you are not going to get an objective viewpoint. They are in business to do abortions, and that is what is going to get pushed. According to Planned Parenthoods latest report, Planned Parenthood does 1 adoption referral for every 114 abortions that it performs.  And most women that get abortions dont even realize that the body parts of their babies are being harvested and sold off to the highest bidder.  Planned Parenthood is committing crimes against humanity on a daily basis, and our national leaders are doing nothing to stop this.  They should be deeply, deeply ashamed of themselves.  If I run for Congress in 2018, and I am very, very strongly considering that, I would promise to always vote against any bill that includes even a single penny of funding for Planned Parenthood.  And if we could get every Republican in the House of Representatives to pledge to never vote for funding for Planned Parenthood under any circumstances, we could finally ensure that Planned Parenthood would be defunded once and for all.  I am so sick and tired of these politicians that use the Pro-Life label to get our votes but then they continue to vote to fund Planned Parenthood time after time.  You cannot be Pro-Life and vote to fund Planned Parenthood, and any politician that wants to try to continue to play this game is not going to get our votes.  Nearly 60 million children have already died, and if we are not going to take a stand now when will we ever be ready to do it?  It is time to defund Planned Parenthood, and it is time to end abortion in America.  If we want to have any sort of a future as a nation, there are no other alternatives."	Fake
" Dreams And Visions Of Jesus Are Fueling The Explosive Growth Of Christianity In Muslim Nations Worldwide http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/dreams-and-visions-of-jesus-are-fueling-the-explosive-growth-of-christianity-in-muslim-nations-worldwide  Millions of Muslims all over the world are giving their lives to Jesus Christ, and in many instances this is happening because of dreams, visions and other supernatural encounters. Recently I have been writing a lot about the decline of Christianity in America and about the judgment that is about to hit our churches. Fortunately, the decaying state of the church in the United States is only a small part of the overall story. In other areas of the globe, Christianity is experiencing absolutely explosive growth even in the midst of horrendous persecution. This is particularly true in Islamic nations, where we are seeing things happen that could have come straight out of the Book of Acts.       All over the planet, Jesus is personally visiting Muslims in supernatural ways, and this has resulted in an enormous wave of conversions. Earlier today, I ran across an article about a family of Syrian refugees that converted to Christianity while living in Lebanon, and it all happened because of a dream  Abu Radwan enters a church on the outskirts of Beirut with his wife and two kids. His wife removes the black headscarf covering her hair. It was here, a year and a half ago, that they converted to Christianity.  Of course it was a difficult decision, Abu Radwan says. I was born into a Muslim family.  The family is from the city of Homs in Syria. They sought refuge in Lebanon at the beginning of the war. Then two years ago, Abu Radwan says Jesus appeared to him in a dream.  I started going to the church, he says. I believed that Jesus was coming to help us, to save us. When it comes to supernatural encounters, there is literally nobody that is out of the reach of the Lord Jesus. One of my favorite examples is a former ISIS fighter that came to know the Lord after Jesus told him in a dream that he was killing my people  Gina Fadely, the director of Youth With A Mission Frontier Missions (YWAM), told The Voice of the Martyrs Radio Network one of their workers met a former ISIS fighter who murdered Christians, but converted after a dream:  He told this YWAM leader that he had begun having dreams of this man in white who came to him and said, You are killing my people. And he started to feel really sick and uneasy about what he was doing, Fadely continued. The fighter said just before he killed one Christian, the man said, I know you will kill me, but I give to you my Bible. The Christian was killed and this ISIS fighter actually took the Bible and began to read it. In another dream, Jesus asked him to follow him and he was now asking to become a follower of Christ and to be discipled. And what has been happening in Iran is nothing short of miraculous. In one of the most radical Islamic nations on the entire planet, millions have come to faith in Christ over the past two decades, and dreams and visions are playing a major role  As Faithwire noted back in November, an Iranian Christian pastor claimed at the time that theres a stunning revival underway in his country, where he says the number of Christian adherents has increased from 100,000 in 1994 to 3 million today. Some claim that Jesus has been appearing in dreams and that those visions have helped spark the conversions. This is part of the great last days move of God that I have been telling people about. In the western world, there seems to be a great misconception that there are hundreds of millions of people in the Islamic world that are out of the reach of the gospel. But this has never been the case, because with God all things are possible.  Just look at the wonderful revival that is going on in Bangladesh. Officially, 89 percent of the population of Bangladesh is Muslim, about 10 percent are Hindus, and less than one percent is Christian. But unofficially it is being estimated that somewhere around 10 percent of the entire nation has now come to Christ, and they continue to convert in huge waves  Pastor Khaleque, 60, a former Muslim and now a Christian street pastor who works among the hill tribes, in the northeast part of Bangladesh, told CFI, In the last 12 months, more than 20,000 Muslims have converted to Christianity. More than 20,000 have converted, and this is becoming a real problem for the Muslims. The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.  Perhaps we are just way too comfortable in the western world. We dont have to pay much of a price for our faith, and so most people dont seem to take it very seriously.  On the other side of the world, standing up for your faith can literally cost you your life. The following comes from a Fox News report from last year  A Christian womans fateful and defiant stance in front of a bulldozer last week evoked the memory of Tiananmen Square and has become a rallying cry against persecution at the hands of the Beijing government.  The woman, identified by Christian activists as Ding Cuimei, wife of the Rev. Li Jiangong, was trying to stop the government-ordered demolition of Beitou Church in the central Hena province city of Zhumadian. Unlike the iconic man who brazenly stopped a tank in the 1989 uprising, Ding was pushed into a ditch and buried alive as horrified congregants watched helplessly. Would you be willing to stand in front of a bulldozer and face potential death for what you believe?  You dont have to be the richest, or the smartest or the best looking to be used by God.  You just have to be willing to be totally sold out for Him.  In the western world we are drowning in money and resources, and there are church buildings all over the place, and yet the United States, Canada and Europe are all becoming post-Christian societies.  But elsewhere we are witnessing an explosion of the faith that is absolutely unprecedented. The following comes from Charles Colson  For instance, in 1900, there were approximately 10 million Christians in Africa. By 2000, there were 360 million. By 2025, conservative estimates see that number rising to 633 million. Those same estimates put the number of Christians in Latin America in 2025 at 640 million and in Asia at 460 million. I believe that a great move of God is coming to the western world too, but a great shaking is going to have to come first. Hearts have grown so hard and so prideful that it is going to take a great humbling before most people understand that they need the Lord. So even though the shaking will be very challenging, we should welcome it, because it will shake multitudes into the Kingdom of God."	Fake
" New Report Says Islam Will Surpass Christianity And Become The Largest Religion In The World http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/new-report-says-islam-will-surpass-christianity-and-become-the-largest-religion-in-the-world  If current trends continue, Islam is on track to become the largest religion in the entire world by the end of this century according a stunning new report that was just released by the Pew Research Center. While it is true that Christianity is still growing on a global basis, it is not growing nearly as rapidly as Islam. So unless something changes, Christianity will only be the second largest faith in the world by the year 2070. According to this newly released report, Islam is the only major religion that is growing faster than the global population overall, and it is being projected that the number of Muslims on the planet will rise by a staggering 73 percent between 2010 and 2050       Islam is the only religion growing faster than the worlds population, and it will be the largest in the world by 2070, research has found.  US-based Pew Research Center analyzed demographic change among the worlds major religions and found that the worlds population of Muslims will grow by 73 percent between 2010 and 2050, compared to 35 percent for Christians, the next fastest-growing faith.  The worlds population will grow by 37 percent over the same period. If those rates of growth continue past 2050, Muslims will outnumber Christians by 2070, the report found. Of course there are religious groups that are growing even faster than Islam, but they were not part of this study.  For example, I have previously written about how witchcraft is the fastest growing faith in America, and yesterday I wrote about how membership in the Satanic Temple in the United States has been absolutely exploding since Donald Trump was elected.  So it isnt just Islam that is gaining ground.  But without a doubt, Islam is now the dominant worldview on much of the planet. Many in the western world tend to think of it as a Middle Eastern religion, but the truth is that most Muslims actually live in the Asia-Pacific region  Some 62 percent of Muslims live in the Asia-Pacific region with large populations in Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Iran and Turkey, Pew researchers said.  In 2050, India is set to take over from Indonesia as the country with the worlds largest Muslim population, according to the study. In India, there truly is a battle going on for the spiritual future of that nation right now. Christianity and Islam are both making a tremendous amount of progress, and this has greatly upset a lot of traditional Hindu groups.  Islam is making a lot of progress in Europe as well. A tremendous amount of immigration has caused the number of European Muslims to surge in recent years, and this new report is projecting that 10 percent of all Europeans will belong to Islam by the year 2050.  Here in the United States, Muslims still only make up a very small percentage of the population, but that percentage is growing too. The following comes directly out of the new Pew Research Center report  In 2015, according to our best estimate, there were 3.3 million Muslims of all ages in the U.S., or about 1% of the U.S. population. Pew Research Centers 2014 Religious Landscape Study (conducted in English and Spanish) found that 0.9% of U.S. adults identify as Muslims. A 2011 survey of Muslim Americans, which was conducted in English as well as Arabic, Farsi and Urdu, estimated that there were 1.8 million Muslim adults (and 2.75 million Muslims of all ages) in the country. That survey also found that a majority of U.S. Muslims (63%) are immigrants.  Our demographic projections estimate that Muslims will make up 2.1% of the U.S. population by the year 2050, surpassing people who identify as Jewish on the basis of religion as the second-largest faith group in the country (not including people who say they have no religion). Once the number of Muslims in the United States surpasses the number of Jewish people, what impact will that have on U.S. politics?  That is something to think about.  The report indicated that there are a couple of primary reasons why Islam is growing so rapidly around the world.  First of all, Muslims tend to have larger families than everyone else. The report said that the average Muslim woman has 3.1 children during her lifetime, while all other groups only have 2.3 children per woman.  So in the end, Islam could end up dominating the world just by simply making more babies than everyone else.  Muslims are also younger on average than other religious groups. According to the report, on a global basis Muslims are seven years younger than the median age of non-Muslims.  Unfortunately, when Muslims become dominant in a society they often want to impose their systems of government, law, economics, etc. on everyone else. That is why sharia law is such a sensitive issue, and the report found that in some Islamic countries an overwhelming majority of Muslims want to impose sharia law on everyone else  For instance, a Pew Research Center survey of Muslims in 39 countries asked Muslims whether they want sharia law, a legal code based on the Quran and other Islamic scripture, to be the official law of the land in their country. Responses on this question vary widely. Nearly all Muslims in Afghanistan (99%) and most in Iraq (91%) and Pakistan (84%) support sharia law as official law. But in some other countries, especially in Eastern Europe and Central Asia  including Turkey (12%), Kazakhstan (10%) and Azerbaijan (8%)  relatively few favor the implementation of sharia law. In his new book entitled Mystery Babylon: Unlocking the Bibles Greatest Prophetic Mystery, best-selling author Joel Richardson suggests that the identity of the Mystery Babylon that we read about in the Book of Revelation could actually be Mecca.  I am not sure whether that is true or not, but nobody can deny that Islam is one of the most dominant forces on the entire planet in 2017, and it looks like it is going to become even more dominant in the years ahead.  And that is troubling news for Christians and those of other faiths, because all you have to do is to look at countries such as Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan and Iran to see what happens to other faiths once Islam takes total control of a nation.  In a truly Islamic state, there is no room for religious freedom, and so the growth of Islam is likely to be one of the greatest global threats to the free exercise of religion for the foreseeable future."

" Look whats dropped by 70% since Trump took office! Yep, you guessed it! http://donaldtrumppotus45.com/2017/07/19/look-whats-dropped-by-70-since-trump-took-office-yep-you-guessed-it/  President Trump electrified the nation during last years Presidential campaign tour. He brought back hope for Americans and our American way of life which had long been dead, especially under the tutelage of recently ousted, failed U.S. President B. Hussein Obama, who proved to be the President for the rest of the world, especially Middle Eastern interests, rather than the President of the United States.  One of the things President Trump campaigned on was immigration reform. He promised to build a big, beautiful wall on our border with Mexico to keep undesirable aliens from entering our country illegally, forcing those immigrants that are safe to come here to wait in line, pay their fees, and be fully vetted before coming.  It seems that our neighbors to the south of the border are so intimidated by President Trumps stance on illegal immigration that the wall hasnt even been necessary to get them to stop their illegal entering into our great nation."

" Read Hillary Clinton's Georgetown Speech on Women's Role in Peace and Politics http://time.com/4721094/hillary-clinton-georgetown-transcript/  Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Friday honored the role of women in global politics and implored the Trump Administration not to retreat from making the U.S. a leader on behalf of peace in the world. This Administration's proposed cuts to international health, development and diplomacy would be a blow to women and children and a grave mistake for our country, she said in her remarks at the award ceremony hosted by the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security. We have to ask, will we be left behind or will we continue to lead the way? Clinton added. I hope the answer is that we will do whatever it takes to make our country and the world stronger and more secure. Read Clinton's full remarks here: Good morning! [applause] Thank you! Thank you so much. [applause] Thank you. [crowd chanting Hillary] Thank you. Wow, let's do that again. [laughter] [applause] This warm, warm welcome is one of the many reasons that I always appreciate coming to this campus, to this great university. And I am so pleased to have a chance to talk with you today about an issue that, as President DeGioia said, is one that has really provided the impetus for a lot of the work that is being done here at the university, particularly in the institute that has been the first of its kind anywhere in the world studying women and security and the contributions that can be made. And I'm grateful to President DeGioias visionary leadership and to this university for your commitment to nurturing diplomats, peacemakers and leaders. I am one of those who thinks we need more peacemakers, diplomats and leaders who are devoted to the ongoing and difficult work of bridging divides, of bringing people together, of trying to find common ground. Now, some of you may have been here back in 2011 when we announced the creation of this institute. It came about for an ultimately profoundly simple reason. About a decade earlier, there had been a landmark resolution passed in the UN Security Council affirming women's crucial roles in peace and security. But the promise of that resolution has, with very few exceptions, remained largely unfulfilled. This is something that I talk often about with my close friend and predecessor, Secretary Madeleine Albright, who bleeds blue and gray. [applause] Because we thought back in the 90s that we needed to do more to elevate the rights and opportunities of women and girls on every level  obviously, education and health and economic opportunity, but also to unleash the potential for involvement in ending conflicts, in creating more secure environments for all people to live in and thrive. So on that day, back in 2011, we came here to Georgetown to declare that the issue of women's full participation in peace and security could no longer be relegated to the margins of international affairs. [applause] I believed then and, I have to tell you, I believe even more fiercely today  that advancing the rights and full participation of women and girls is the great, unfinished business of the 21st century. [applause] It seems self-evident. Its not only the right and moral goal for us to be pursuing. After all, women represent half of humanity, and we do have a fundamental right to participate in the decisions that shape our lives. But  and this is what I want to really impress upon you  this is strategic and necessary for matters of peace, prosperity and security. It is not a partisan issue. Its a human issue. A rising tide of women's rights lifts entire nations. So each year, when Ive had the chance to come back for these awards, I am inspired, although increasingly not surprised to see how far this institute has come. Georgetown is very fortunate, in my highly biased opinion, to have my dear friend, Ambassador Melanne Verveer, at the helm and backed up fully by the leadership of the university because the leaders  as President DeGioia just read out  that youve recognized, women and men alike, have come from different backgrounds, certainly different countries, but united in the belief that women are not only victims of war, but must be viewed and helped to become agents of change, makers of peace and drivers of progress. That was the principle behind our efforts at the State Department in the first term of President Obama. We wanted to set a standard, and Im proud of it because I do see it as strategic and necessary. Not just a nice thing to do on the margins somewhere deep in the bowels of the State Department, but front and center. Because standing up for the rights and opportunities of women and girls must be a cornerstone of American global leadership. And therefore, it must be woven throughout our foreign policy with the resources, staffing, accountability and attention needed to back up that commitment. [applause] What I was very pleased by and excited to know is how the U.S. military also recognizes the role of women in peace and security. Over the years, Ive had the privilege of working alongside and standing beside some of our military leaders right on this stage. Admiral Sandy Winnefeld, former vice chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Michle Flournoy, former undersecretary for defense for policy, helped to put new emphasis on stopping rape and gender-based violence in conflict zones and post-conflict areas and empowering women to help make and keep peace. This is especially important now, when we have, across the globe, more than 60 million refugees fleeing not only conflicts, but famine and drought and disease. And we have to come to terms with that because, again, it's not just somebody else's problem. It will affect the stability of nations and regions, which in turn, could very well bring problems, whether it be conflict and terrorism or disease and criminal activity to our shores. Global progress depends on the progress of women. I know we've seen positive results of that theme being actually implemented ever since the U.N. Women's Conference in Beijing in 1995. But I'm here also to say we are seeing signals of a shift that should alarm us all. This administration's proposed cuts to international health, development and diplomacy would be a blow to women and children and a grave mistake for our country. Some of you may have seen the recent letter from more than 120 retired generals and admirals to Congress and the administration, urging the Congress and the White House not to retreat from these programs, which represent our values. These distinguished men and women who served in uniform recognize that turning our back on diplomacy won't make our country safer. It will undermine our security and our standing in the world. Defense Secretary Mattis said it well when he said, If you cut funds to the State Department, that means he has to buy more ammunition. So the work that is done here at this institute, here at Georgetown, making the evidence-based case for the role of women and peace in security is incredibly important. It's always mattered, but today, it's even more critical. As this institute has grown, so too has the body of evidence showing that when women participate in peacemaking and peacekeeping, we are all safer and more secure. Studies show  here I go again, talking about research, evidence and facts  [laughter] [applause] But in fact, when women are included in peace negotiations, agreements are less likely to fail and more likely to last. And we know that women's rights and physical safety are often the very first targets of fundamentalists. We also know that women are often the first to spot conflict on the horizon, coming their way. And when their insight and information is ignored, it often leads to consequences that might have been averted. At a time when sexual violence continues to be used as a strategy by terrorist groups, when women are being recruited by ISIS and Boko Haram, evidence suggests leaders who want to do more to guard against terrorism and violence should work even harder to help support and enable the participation of women. Now, before anybody jumps to any conclusions, I will state, clearly, women are not inherently more peaceful than men. That is a stereotype. That belongs in the alternative reality. [laughter] [applause] But, history does show that when women are at the peace table, they bring together coalitions, and they work really hard to build consensus. And they are the ones most likely to shine a bright light on issues of human rights, transitional justice, national reconciliation and economic renewal. I've seen this. Over the years, I worked with the women of Northern Ireland and watched as they reached across sectarian divides to forge a lasting peace. And when that process started back in the 90s, who would have ever predicted that Martin McGuinness, who just passed away, would ever shake hands with Queen Elizabeth? We've seen the women of Liberia force an end to a bloody civil war. If you've never seen the movie Pray the Devil Back to Hell, I highly recommend it because it shows, in very personal ways, the points that I am making from this podium today. The women of Liberia went to where the men had been talking about ending the conflict for weeks and weeks, a hotel in Ghana. They surrounded it, and they would not leave. They wouldnt let those who had met to negotiate the peace out of a window or a door until they came to agreement. And then, of course, they ended up electing Ellen Johnson Sirleaf as the first woman president on the continent of Africa. [applause] I have seen women in the Democratic Republic of Congo survive the most horrific, almost unimaginable abuse and cruelty and then summon the resilience to rebuild and help others go on. In Colombia, which you will hear much more about in a few minutes, a country whose trajectory I have followed intently for years, we've seen women organize, agitate and negotiate to help bring to a close more than 50 years of bloodshed. While conflict raged and efforts to stop the violence failed, women not only took their places at the table, they opened up the peace process to women across Colombia and urged over and over again that all parties not walk away until they reached an agreement. So if we are to build more just, free and peaceful countries and indeed a world, it's not enough just to pay lip service to empowering women. We have to take seriously their concerns and give them the tools to be equal partners in helping to shape the world they inhabit. The leaders we are honoring here today have seen that firsthand. From Humberto de la Calle, the rock of the peace negotiations in Havana. [applause] Yes, a round of applause for Humberto. [applause] Mara Paulina Riveros, one of two women appointed to represent the Colombian government in the talks. [applause] Elena Ambrosi, who has worked tirelessly behind the scenes, like so many women, to help make peace a reality. [applause] And Jineth Bedoya Lima, a journalist who continued her pursuit of the truth and her advocacy for victims of sexual violence in the face of her own horrors. [applause] Now like so many peace agreements, as hard as it was to get to it after 50 years of war, it is just the first step. Implementing peace will be a constant task. As hard as it is to imagine letting go of the peace that is so hard-won, there will be forces at work in the country from all sides to undermine it, to act as if it didnt apply to them. To do everything possible to prevent it from becoming the reality in the lives of Colombians that it can be. Yes, the work will require difficult decisions, transitional justice and economic viability. But peace is truly within reach. So, from peace processes, like the one we celebrate today, to important steps that nations and institutions are taking to recognize the role of women in confronting violent extremism and addressing climate change and standing up against terrorism and conflicts of all kinds, we've got to continue this work. And I am pleading that our government will continue its leadership role on behalf of peace in the world because the world must continue this work with or without U.S. involvement. [applause] And the choice is ours to make. In this complicated, interconnected, interdependent world of ours, its not as though you can pick one or two, three things that you say, Well, thats all Im going to work on. Events move too quickly. Borders dissolve in the face of pressures. The great connectivity of the internet can spawn both opportunity and despair. So we have to ask, will we be left behind or will we continue to lead the way? I hope the answer is that we will do whatever it takes to make our country and the world stronger and more secure. Standing up for our values, for human rights, and opportunities, security for all. And continuing to finish the business of making sure that girls and women have the same rights as men and boys. And by extending and guaranteeing those rights, unleashing human potential, the likes of which the world has never seen. That is what I hope your generation, students of Georgetown, will be committed to actually making a reality. Thank you all very much. [applause]"	Fake

By allowing his comrades throughout the government to drastically change rules and laws on their own, Congress was successfully circumvented. Its bad enough when our moronic politicians shove crap down our throats but its even worse when unelected bureaucrats do it in secret. Thats just the epitome of corruption. One of the agencies most guilty of secret abuses is Housing and Urban Development. HUD has a scary amount of power in shaping our nations communities and not only that, ample opportunity exists for it to waste taxpayer money. And they didnt just waste your money under President Obama; they threw giant wads of it down the toilet. As reported at Yes Im Right, as the new head of HUD, Dr. Ben Carson called for an immediate audit to uncover any wastefulness and abuse. Why? Because this guy actually does his job. To no ones surprise  but to everyones horror  the Inspector General in charge of the review found half a trillion dollars in unaccounted funds. Apparently, HUDS books are so horribly managed that a full audit couldnt even be completed during an initial inquiry. Its so bad that this is looking less like incompetence and more like outright corruption and kickbacks. Heres what the report said: When the IG remained unable to issue an opinion for fiscal years 2015 or 2016, he gave Obama staffers a three-month extension. Thus, their reprieve allowed them to fix $3.4 billion in 2015 errors and $516.4 billion in 2016 errors. After HUDs re-submission of paperwork, 11 material weaknesses, seven significant deficiencies, and five instances of failure to comply with laws and regulations remain unresolved. The continued problems were due to an inability to establish a compliant control environment, implement adequate financial accounting systems, retain key financial staff, and identify appropriate accounting principles and policies. Obamas HUD lackey, Brian Sullivan, dared to say otherwise on the matter, when in December of 2016 he claimed: HUD does apply generally accepted accounting standards, despite the fact the IG report concluded otherwise. That, and theres the half a trillion dollars in errors, which would lend credence to the IGs conclusions. When Trump first tapped Carson for the HUD position, the typical circus of leftist clowns came out and bashed the choice, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) being one of the most critical."

" Who Says Buddhists Are Killing Rohingya Muslims? Buddhists Are Simply Defending Them From Slaughter Since 1947 http://www.religionmind.com/2017/09/who-says-buddhists-are-killing-rohingya.html  There's a big misconception about the violence in Burma that has caused severe casualties to both Rohingya Muslims and Burmese Buddhists. Therefore it is important that a fair assessment to this issue is done to shed light on the grey areas and enlighten those who are clueless on the subject.  The Rohingyas are a Muslim minority who migrated from Bangladesh and reside in Myanmar. The community procreated in large numbers within a very short period of time without any family planning and considerations to limited resources, because of which the native community in the area has became a minority and deprived of their own lands that were grabbed by increased population of Rohingyans.   Bangladesh Pakistan Indonesian Muslims Kill Burmese Buddhists   According to Rohingyas, they are indigenous to Rakhine State, while the Burmese historians claim that they migrated to Burma from Bengal primarily during the period of British rule in Burma, and to a lesser extent, after the Burmese independence in 1948 and Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971.  General Ne Win's government, in 1982, enacted the Burmese nationality law, which denied citizenship to the Rohingyas honoring the opinion of vast majority of Burmese. (96%) The decision also came as a result as the Rohingyas were rebelling the government for several decades with the support of external forces, mainly from separatists movements and extremist groups including Al Qaeda.  The Rohingya insurgency in Western Myanmar was an insurgency in northern Rakhine State (also known as Arakan),  waged by insurgents belonging to the Rohingya ethnic minority. Most clashes have occurred in the Maungdaw District, which borders Bangladesh.    Local mujahideen groups were rebelling government forces From 1947 to 1961, in an attempt to have the mostly Rohingya populated Mayu peninsula in northern Rakhine State secede from Myanmar, and have it be annexed by East Pakistan (present-day Bangladesh). In late 1950s they lost most of their support and surrendered to government forces.  The modern Rohingya insurgency in northern Rakhine began in 2001 although Shwe Maung, the then MP of the Rohingya-majority, rejected claims that new Islamist insurgent groups had begun operating along the Bangladeshi border.  Latest incident that got reported was in October 2016, where clashes have erupted on the Myanmar-Bangladesh border, with Rohingya insurgents linked to foreign Islamists suspected of being the perpetrators.  However Rohingyas have stayed in Burma for several generations and account for nearly 4% of Myanmars population.  On the other hand the incident where brutal rape and murder of a Rakhine Buddhist woman by Muslim men, followed by the killing of Rohingya Muslims (as retaliation) sparked the communal riots between Rakhine Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims. This was not exactly a one sided massacre, but a communal riot with victims from both sides.  The issue became more severe when Rohingyas started killing monks too. Often by beheading them. At least 19 such monk killings were reported within a couple of months where monks started to take the side of the native groups who were fighting the Rohingyas.   Now the question every one of us must be asking is, why do Muslims kill Christians? Why do Muslims kill Muslims? pretty much everywhere in the world. None of the Buddhists we know did/ does / wants to kill Muslims, at least not because of any religious reasons. But in Myanmar we find low tolerance towards proselytism, this means theres no problem with any religion you may have, as long as you stick to it and dont attempt to convert others. The Christians have learned their lesson a long time ago although they continue to do it without being aggressive about it, the Hindus never had such ambitions, the Buddhists never engage in that, but the MuslimsWellWell...Well  On the other hand Rohingyas communities tend to be highly conservative of inter-faith marriages where they punish and sometimes kills their women in case they marry someone outside Rohingyas. While they are ready to marry Buddhist women and convert them to Islam. This doesnt sit well with some conservative factions of the Buddhist majority, for obvious reasons.  Christians and hindus, the 2nd and 4th largest communities, by population, are integrating just fine despite many Christian ethnicities engaging against the Buddhist Bamar (Kachin, Chin, Karen, etc), the disputes are historical, territorial and resource-based, never religious. Also, insulting religion, ANY religion, for whatever reason, is illegal in Myanmar and would land you in jail in a matter of hours. And thats actively enforced, probably for good reason.  Rohingyas Muslims were welcomed as guests in the beginning according to historians. There was little or no problem at the beginning. Problems such as rebelling did happen later but an agreement was reached and they disarmed in early 60s. Although minor conflicts occurred among both communities, nothing serious occurred until about 5 years ago where Muslims gathered in numbers and walked the streets killing the minority natives in their areas. Which is why Burmese Buddhists started counter attacking the Muslims who were killing their brothers and sisters in Rohingyas lands. Below video is self explanatory to the fact that how Muslims gathered in hundreds to attack Minority Buddhists in  Rakhine State.  Therefore, it is critical that one needs to understand that Buddhists do not kill Muslims but the natives are responding to the rebels who are virtually on a ethnic cleansing mission is Rakhine State. If Buddhists were at fault, they should probably be attacking Christians too. At least some type of discrimination against Christians which is the 2nd largest religious community in Burma which has never happened.  It must also be noted that no one should be linking the unrest to religious war. Its a political war where natives trying to protect their life from insurgents belonging to a migrated community. Who are not only trying to procreate at a disturbing rate but also trying to convert natives to their faith forcibly by direct and indirect means. To make it worst, they are promoting Rohingyas men to marry Buddhists but has banned Rohingyas women to marry Buddhists. Its a riot the Rohingyas started by attacking Buddhists and other way round as it is evidently true to anywhere else in the world. It is Rohingyas who kill people Chanting Allahu Akbar and not a single Buddhist because Buddhists can't possibly justify killing according to their teachings. But their survival has become a priority which compel them to fight back.  Buddhists in Burma have seen Rohingyas rioting against them for more than half a century for no apparent reason except the need to create a separate Islam region in Burma with the funding that come from extremist organizations and middle east in addition to the support they have from neighboring Pakistan and Bangladesh. Its as the last resort they have opted to deal with the obvious problem they have at hand. It was simply a question for Buddhists weather they were willing to die at the Hands of Muslim separatists or  try to prevail by fighting back.

Daily news reporter who published a full page article with the women says that he is surprised to realize that this story did never come out during Trump's run to the office or thereafter. I wonder why this story never came on any mainstream media that only portrayed Trump as a person who do not care for poor.  Trump Allowed This Black Homeless Woman to Live Rent Free in Trump Tower For 8 years.  Tracy Beckerman, the homeless black women says that, for over eight years, she is living in the Trump Tower without having to pay anything although she now has a good job that pays more than 50 Dollars an hour.  She says a man appeared as a security personnel at Trump tower once came to her and asked her to leave when she was roaming close to the building. I refused and said that I don't have a place to go. Then the man asked me about my whereabouts. I told him my entire story and how I was suffering my entire life. Two days later I got invited by Trump and he said I can live in his tower for free until I find a place to go. Since then he did not force me or asked me if I would leave his building although now I can afford to rent one., Says Tracy.   She says everything changed from the day she started living in Trump's building that was built for rich. I was the poorest ever lived there. Poorest ever will live there. When I went looking for job and said I lived in Trump tower, everyone was surprised. It helped me to get better jobs. In fact with a handsome pay. I am glad that my life changed. I know there is a criticism against trump on how he treat women. I am not going to say anything about it. But my experience was a total contrast to what is being said and reported. Maybe I was an exception ! "	Fake

Conservatives recognized that America was at risk if Democrats kept the power.Recently, the full panel of 9 justices came together for the first time to decide the fate of Islam being taught within our public school system. The decision shows just how close we came to disaster. The 5-4 ruling ultimately decided that Sharia Law or any ideology that contradicts basic human rights will not be taught in Americas public schools.This shows just how important the election of President Trump was and his decision to appoint Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.The government certainly has no business being involved in religion, but this isnt a government issue or a religious issue, Gorsuch said in a statement. This is about the judicial branch interpreting the laws as they apply to the teaching of religion. We should be teaching any religions in this country besides standard Judaeo-Christianity, as our founders wanted, and we certainly shouldnt be filling the children with lies about Islam being a religion of peace when they see the carnage on the news almost every day.Gorsuch cast the tie-breaking vote that decided that only the true historical account of Islamic history would be taught in the classroom."

That order was to implement new vetting measures to ensure that no one from the said Arabic countries would be permitted to enter into US. Going further to deal with the Islamization of America, as Trump administration calls it, Trump has signed a new executive order prohibiting any Islamic customary including sharia and Muslim marriage practices.  Trump signs executive orders to ban sharia  Speaking to media on Saturday at the Pentagon, president Trump said that this order would mean that no one will be able to violate the American constitution and practice their own things in US soil. He added that we know Muslims are trying to take the law in to their hands and act as a religious police within their communities. We should not tolerate it because this is Great America and not middle east.  These practices make young Muslims radical and ultimately terrorists. If they want to live like they do in Saudi, we don't want them here. We need them to abide by our laws and customs.   During the presidential campaign Trump assured that he will take extreme measures to deal with Islamization in America. Most of his executive orders reflects that he wants to corner middle eastern immigrants.  Last couple of years we heard several cases where Muslims disrespecting our laws and systems and doing things their way,  Trump said at Pentagon ceremony. Some muftis publicly said that their prophet's law and Koran is above our law and the constitution.

Just a bad apple won't chance our welcoming attitude towards migrants or anyone coming from Middle east. She said, its unfair to put restrictions such as travel bans on anyone wanting to come to UK, she said when she met several prominent activists in London who are direct critics of Trump. Under these circumstances, a visit to UK would be controversial, given Trumps policies and provocative use of social media, such as when he misquoted and berated the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, after the London Bridge attack.

An updated version of the twenty-dollar bill featuring the American Confederate general Robert E. Lee is scheduled to make its debut in a handful of southern states later this month, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Treasury announced on Tuesday. The new bill includes a portrait of the middle-aged Confederate general on its face while the reverse side features a scene depicting the Second Battle of Bull Run. We are pleased to announce that the new twenty-dollar bill will make its debut on Monday, September 11th, in eleven states, including South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Virginia, Alabama, and Texas, Treasury spokesperson Keith Davis announced during a press conference Tuesday morning. The decision to replace the existing twenty-dollar banknote, which entered circulation in 1996, comes as President Donald J. Trump continues to work diligently to reverse his predecessors policies. We had Barack Obama, who  for eight years and without any prior authorization from Congress  decided he was going to put Harriet Tubman on the twenty-dollar bill, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway told CNNs Wolf Blitzer. Well, Wolf, he cant do that, Conway argued, continuing, President Trump cares very deeply about the American people and he has said, time and time again, if were going to do it, well replace one great man with another. Less than a week after Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin pointedly avoided voicing support for a $20 bill featuring Harriet Tubman, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing  the agency responsible for producing paper currency  released a statement saying current color and shading capabilities limit our ability to adequately depict [Harriet Tubman] on most forms of U.S. currency. The statement went on to say that increased shading would make the bill too dark and, therefore, more susceptible to counterfeiting. Treasury spokesperson Keith Davis said the redesigned twenty-dollar bill is scheduled for a nationwide release on January 19, 2018, and will coincide with the 211th anniversary of General Robert E. Lees birthday, as requested by the White House."	Fake
" CIA Documents Confirm Hitler Fled To Argentina After WW2 http://yournewswire.com/cia-hitler-argentina-ww2/ Newly declassified CIA documents confirm that Adolf Hitler escaped Germany after World War II and took refuge in Argentina. The files confirm earlier FBI documents, which claim that the U.S. government knew the Nazi Fuehrer was alive and well, living in the Andes Mountains long after the war had ended. In 1955 the chief of the CIAs Western Hemisphere Division (WHD) received a secret memo with the subject line Operational: Adolf Hitler, from the CIA station chief in Venezuela that contained proof Hitler was still alive in South America. Thefreethoughtproject.com reports: Interestingly, these revelations seem to confirm declassified FBI documents that also claimed sources had indicated that Hitler was indeed living in Argentina. While the official story sold to the global public is that Hitler died of suicide in the Fuhrerbunker, the actual truth may be vastly different from the popularized version of events. The acting CIA station chiefs informants, CIMELODY, was contacted by a former SS trooper Phillip Citroen, who claimed to have been in contact with Hitlerwho was living under the pseudonym Adolph Schuttlemayerabout once a month in Colombia, while there on a trip from Maracaibo as an employee of the Royal Dutch Shipping Company. Citroen said that Hitler had left Colombia for Argentina around January 1955, and erroneously suggested that the statute of limitations for war crimes had passedas it had been 10 years since the end of World War IIand that the Allies could no longer prosecute Hitler as a war criminal. The CIA documents reveal that Citroen told CIMELODY that he had even taken a photo with Hitler, and provided a grainy picture that was included in the CIA memowith Hitler purported to be the man on the right. After reviewing the CIAs files, the WHD chief reported that Citroen had only the year before reported that a colony of Nazis was present in Colombia that engaged in idolatry of the Nazi past addressing him as der Fuhrer and affording him the Nazi salute and storm trooper adulation, in reference to Hitler himself. The station chief wrote the WHP chief again only days later to engage in further investigation of whether or not it really was Adolf Hitler. The HPD chief then incredibly made the decision to drop further inquiry, as he felt enormous efforts could be expended on this matter with remote possibilities of establishing anything concrete. A seemingly strange response considering the magnitude of the report and veracity of the sources credibility in that Citroen was a former Nazi himself. As The Free Thought Project previously reported: South America did indeed play host to many fleeing Nazisincluding sadistic doctor Josef Mengele, whose torturous experimentation of Nazi concentration camp prisoners eventually branched into the study of twins. Later, in a small town in Brazil, one in five pregnancies resulted in births of twinssomething Argentine historian Jorge Camarasa claimed in 2009 evidenced Mengeles handiwork following his escape from Germany. Perhaps there is more to the story than a war weary public was led to believe in the wake of the devastation of WWII, and the truth lies somewhere other than what has became the official narrative of Hitlers death in the Fuhrerbunker with his bridewith reality being much closer to an escape with may other Nazi war criminals to South America."

" Edward Snowden: Osama Bin Laden is Still Alive Living in the Bahamas http://www.revolutions2040.com/edward-snowden-osama-bin-laden-still-alive-living-bahamas/ Edward Snowden: Osama Bin Laden is Still Alive Living in the Bahamas: Edward Snowden (the NSA whistleblower) has made another astonishing revelation. He apparently has documents that prove Osama Bin Laden is on the CIAs payroll and currently living a luxury lifestyle in the Bahamas. In 2013, Edward Snowden, a former contractor for the National Security Agency (NSA), released various documents regarding government surveillance programs. This resulted in him being charged for committing several crimes. All of the charges carry a sentence of up to 10 years in prison. Due to this and the fact he believed it was the correct decision to reveal the shocking extent of phone surveillance by U.S. intelligence agency, he had no choice but to flee. He currently resides in Russia, this is where he has be offered asylum for one year. Snowden has yet again provided a shocking piece of information. The Moscow Tribune reports that Snowden claims that Osama Bin Laden the infamous former leader of Al Qaeda, is in fact still alive and is in receipt of cash courtesy of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). I have documents showing that Bin Laden is still on the CIAs payroll,  Snowden claims. He is still receiving more than $100,000 a month, which are being transferred through some front businesses and organizations, directly to his Nassau bank account. I am not certain where he is now, but in 2013, he was living quietly in his villa with five of his wives and many children. Snowden claims the CIA faked the death of Osama Bin Laden. After reporting him dead, the man himself and his family were moved to a secret location in the Bahamas. Osama Bin Laden was one of the CIAs most efficient operatives for a long time, Snowden claims. What kind of message would it send their other operatives if they were to let the SEALs kill him? They organized his fake death with the collaboration of the Pakistani Secret services, and he simply abandoned his cover. Since everyone believes he is dead, nobodys looking for him, so it was pretty easy to disappear. Without the beard and the military jacket, nobody recognizes him. NaijaPicks say that these documents that prove this controversial claim are featured in his 2015 book. Despite the fact Snowden says he was trying to help the citizens of America by releasing these documents, he is still classed as a fugitive in the USA. This is also despite approximately 168,000 people signing a petition calling for Snowden to be pardoned. This was rejected by the White House rejected on July 28, 2015. Whilst resident in Hong Kong, Snowden was interviewed by several journalists inside a secret location. He was asked why he left his own country, his reply to The Guardian was: I dont want to live in a society that does these sort of things I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded."

The claims came after the Chinese moon rover allegedly couldnt find any proof of American landings on the Moon. The rover took thousands of photos and after analyzing them the Chinese discovered that theres no trace of these moon landings. Now the Chinese space program has launched a petition, already signed by 200 of its high-ranking officials, demanding explanation from the US government and the release of classified NASA information which will finally put an end to all the speculations and give definitive proof of the American moon landings. Or maybe it was just an elaborate hoax with the sole purpose to fool the world about its space program capabilities. Whatever the case they need to come forward and speak the truth. The petition has been signed by world-renowned nuclear engineer, Yury Ignatyevich Mukhin, and numbers of other prominent Russian engineers and ex-KGB agents.

" Australia Becomes Worlds Most Microchipped Nation http://www.revolutions2040.com/australia-becomes-worlds-microchipped-nation/ (YNW)   Australia Becomes Worlds Most Microchipped Nation: Australia has become the first widely microchipped nation, with Australians readily parting with $150 of their own money to pay for fashionable microchips under their skin  without stopping to think of the consequences. Mainstream media in the US has been waging a propaganda campaign trying to normalize the idea of microchips for humans, airing reports claiming that children will be microchipped sooner rather than later and that Americans will accept this because it will make their children safer. But while Americans remain wary about the idea of microchips for humans, the campaign to normalize microchips has been so successful in Australia that people with RFID microchips permanently embedded in their bodies now consider them as another organ of the body and boast that they can use them as loyalty cards in stores and receive discounts. The only catch is that these slaves of fashion dont know exactly what has been put into their body. They also cant be sure who has access to their personal data. If history repeats, human microchips will go from being technology adopted for its convenience and safety and then overnight will become mandatory for you and your family  or else. News.com.au reports: It may sound like sci-fi, but hundreds of Australians are turning themselves into super-humans who can unlock doors, turn on lights and log into computers with a wave of the hand. Shanti Korporaal, from Sydney, is at the center of the phenomenon after having two implants inserted under her skin. Now she can get in to work and her car without carrying a card or keys and says her ultimate goal is to completely do away with her wallet and cards. You set up your life so you never have to worry about any password or PINs, she said.Its the same technology as Paypass, so Im hoping youll be able to pay for things with it. The microchips, which are the size of a grain of rice, can act like a business card and transfer contact details to smartphones, and hold complex medical data. Advocates claim that in the future microchips will even release medication into your body. Shanti has had some messages from conservative Christians on Facebook telling her shes going to hell, but the reaction has mainly been one of intrigue. My nana wants one, laughs Shanti. Ive had more opposition to my tattoos than Ive ever had to the chip. My friends are jealous. When the 27-year-old realized just how coveted the implants were, she set up a distribution service called Chip My Life with her husband, Skeeve Stevens. It costs between $80 and $140 depending on the sophistication of the technology, and (while you can do it at home) they work with doctors who charge $150 to insert the implant. They do minor surgery, Botox and so on, says Shanti. They give you a local, an injection and a quick ultrasound to make sure its in place. The biohacking couple both have RFID (radio-frequency identification) chips in their left hands and NFC (near-field communication) chips in the right. The implant is almost impossible to spot, leaving a mark as small as a freckle. Shanti is appearing at todays Sydney launch of cyborg-themed video game Deus Ex Mankind Divided alongside US implantable technology pioneer Amal Graafstra. Amal considers himself a guinea-pig for human augmentation, making headlines in the US last week with a prototype of the worlds first implant-activated smart gun. He became one of the worlds first RFID implantees in 2005, and has since founded an online store to sell the at home kits to people who want to upgrade their body. Hes written a book, spoken at TEDx and appeared in documentaries. On a psychological level, this is completely different to a smartphone or a Fitbit, because it goes in you, he said. Your kidneys are working hard but youre not thinking about them, its not something you have to manage. Its given me the ability to communicate with machines. Its literally integrated into who I am. He is aware of the ethical and security concerns but points this is simply a case of computing in the body. Rather than worry about people being forced to be microchipped, hes now busy advocating for the rights of citizens who use them. He believes the destruction of the chip could in some cases classify as assault (as with a pacemaker) and other dangers might be governments forcibly extracting implants or data from them. I want to make sure its treated as part of the body, like an organ, he says. One firm in Sweden has allowed employees to choose chips over a work pass, with 400 taking up the offer, but Amal says he more often hears from interested individuals who want to try it out. At the moment, its mainly access  house, computer motorcycle. But in the future, theres the potential to use it for transit, payment. You could get rid of your keys and maybe your wallet. Other uses might include children tapping to let parents know they are at school safely, refugees checking in at camps or women at shelters. It can share diet, exercise and sleep information with you and your doctor, and the next generation could even release medicine as and when you need it. For Shanti, adding an extra dimension to life is a childhood fantasy come true. Ever since watching movies like the Terminator, Matrix and Minority Report I wondered if we could actually live like that. I always wondered why we all werent living as super-humans."	Fake

In 1984, Gallo filed a U.S. patent application for his invention of the HIV/AIDS virus. Dailypost.co.za  reports: Normally, when a patent is filed and approved, as Dr. Gallos was, anyone who uses the product or invention owes a royalty payment to the artificer. Thus, holding the intellectual property laws to their fullest interpretations, one must solely marvel why Dr. Gallo has yet to file a proceedings seeking to recover damages from the usage of his invention? As odd as this state of affairs could sound, it bears need for extra scrutiny. The scientific evidence is complete and compelling, the AIDS Virus is a designer bi-product of the U.S. Special Virus program. The Special Virus program was a federal virus development program that persisted in the U.S from 1962 until 1978.. The U.S. Special Virus was then added as compliment to vaccinum inoculations in Africa and Manhattan. Shortly thereafter the world was engulfed with mass infections of somebodys animal virus that differed from any illustrious human sickness, it was highly contagious and additional significantly, A review of the Special Virus Flow Chart (research logic) reveals the United States was seeking a virus particle that might negatively impact the defense mechanisms of the system. The program sought to modify the ordination of the virus particle during which to splice in associate degree animal wasting disease referred to as Visna. According to the Proceedings of the us of America, AIDS is an biological process, laboratory development of the peculiar Visna Virus, first detected in Icelandic sheep. Recently, American and world scientists ensure with 100 percent certainty the laboratory genesis of AIDS. This fact is more underscored once one reviews the multiply-spliced nature of the HIV tat sequence and Dr. Gallos 1971 Special Virus paper, Reverse Transcriptase of Type-C virus Particles of Human Origin.Dr. Gallos 1971 Special Virus paper is identical to his 1984 announcement of AIDS. Upon further review the record reveals that he filed his patent on AIDS, before he made the announcement with Secretary troubler. Earlier this year, Dr. Gallo conceded his role as a Project Officer for the federal virus development program, the Special Virus. The Flow Chart of the program and the 15 progress reports are undeniable proof of the United States game to cull world populations via the unleashing of a stealing biological organism that may waste humanity. In light of this true genesis of the worlds most divesting biological scourge, it is the u. s. that owes royal payments to the innocent victims. Each associated each victim of AIDS is worthy of a proper apology and a way of economic closure for an invention of death and despair, perpetrated by the United States. The eyes of the world are upon the overall Accounting Offices Health Care Team, under the direction of William J. Scanlon. Between 1964 and 1978, the secret federal virus program spent $550 million dollars of payer cash to create AIDS. It is now necessary to pay no matter it takes to dismantle associate invention that has junction rectifier to the best crime against humanity within the history of the globe."	Fake
" Putin Issues International Arrest Warrant For George Soros..

Dead or Alive Russia has officially declared that Billionaire George Soros is a wanted man in their country, citing him and his organizations as a threat to Russian national security. Putin banned Soros from Russia last year due to the fact that Soros helped to nearly destroy the Russian economy in the early 1990s. Matt Taibbi of the Rolling Stone said of Goldman Sachs six years ago: The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that its everywhere. The worlds most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. In fact, the history of the recent financial crisis, which doubles as a history of the rapid decline and fall of the suddenly swindled dry American empire, reads like a Whos Who of Goldman Sachs graduates. Obviously Soros wants to be like Goldman Sachs. Phil Butler puts it well when he says: George Soros has a finger in every political pie there is. If there is a crisis on our world, its a safe bet hes had a hand in it. One can say that Soros and Goldman Sachs are ideologically part of the same brotherhood. Their strategy is a little different, but the end result is the destruction of lives via the economic system (be it capitalism or socialism) and political manipulation. Thats why Soros seems to think that he is invincible. He thinks he can move the political and economic planet in a few blinks of an eye and no one can tell him to stop. In fact, he writes books such as The Alchemy of Finance. Soros thinks he can kill political stability throughout Europe and indeed in America with no challenge. Soros is certainly old, but he doesnt want to be obsolete. His organization has recently been caught conducting covert operations designed to destabilize Russia. Here is an interesting quote from the leaked files of Soros Open Society Foundation: Our inclination is to engage in activities and with actors that will understand and counter Russian support to movements defending traditional valuesNaming and shaming from us is problematic: we are also in the business of channeling money into other countries for political purposes."

" Planned Parenthood Founder Planned To Exterminate Black Race http://yournewswire.com/planned-parenthood-exterminate-black/ Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, the largest abortion provider in the world, is held up as a hero by liberals who claim she liberated women and ethnic minorities from lives of servitude. But the truth about Margaret Sanger and Planned Parenthood is a lot darker than liberals and ethnic minority leaders would have you believe. Sanger, hero of the contemporary left, was a self-described eugenist wanted to exterminate the black race, eradicate people with disabilities. Sanger admitted her entire lifes purpose was to promote birth control, but it was actually minorities she wanted to control  not the white race she belonged to. Her goal was to create a nation of thoroughbreds  and that meant tricking ethnic minorities into killing their unborn. On blacks, immigrants and indigents: ...human weeds, reckless breeders, spawning human beings who never should have been born.  Margaret Sanger wrote in her book Pivot of Civilization, referring to immigrants and poor people. On sterilization & racial purification: Sanger believed that, for the purpose of racial purification, couples should be rewarded who chose sterilization. (From Birth Control in America, The Career of Margaret Sanger, by David Kennedy, p. 117, quoting a 1923 Sanger speech.) Of course modern-day liberals are blissfully unaware that they have canonized a racist eugenicist, whose ideology was so extreme that Hitler claimed to take inspiration from her far-left pseudo-science. Liberal cognitive dissonance and censorship does not allow for anything based in fact for use in their echo chambers. Next time you hear a liberal speaking from their favorite position  the moral high ground  and praising Planned Parenthood, you might want to remind them of the organizations evil roots. Sanger espoused the thinking of eugenicists  similar to Darwins survival of the fittest  but related the concept to human society, saying the genetic makeup of the poor, and minorities, for example, was inferior. On the extermination of blacks: We do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population, she said, if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members. Womans Body, Womans Right: A Social History of Birth Control in America, by Linda Gordon On respecting the rights of the mentally ill: In her Plan for Peace, Sanger outlined her strategy for eradication of those she deemed feebleminded. Among the steps included in her evil scheme were immigration restrictions; compulsory sterilization; segregation to a lifetime of farm work; etc. Birth Control Review, April 1932, p. 107 On adultery: A womans physical satisfaction was more important than any marriage vow, Sanger believed. Birth Control in America, p. 11 On marital sex: The marriage bed is the most degenerating influence in the social order, Sanger said. (p. 23) [Quite the opposite of Gods view on the matter: Marriage is honorable in all, and the bed undefiled; but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge. (Hebrews 13:4) On abortion: Criminal abortions arise from a perverted sex relationship under the stress of economic necessity, and their greatest frequency is among married women.

We thought about creating a new denomination for Obama, but George Washington has had plenty of time in the sun, John Apple from the Federal Reserve said. Weve needed to change things up for a while now. The Bureau of Engraving and Printing has released several comps but a design has not been finalized. The Bureau will release all compositions in early 2016 and poll the American public letting them help decide which design works best. Many presidents were bandied about as the new face of the one-dollar bill including Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. Reportedly, Reagan almost got the nod to replace Washington, but people within the Federal Reserve felt Obama brought a much needed multiracial mix to American currency. Obama being of mixed-race was probably what tipped things; however, we looked at overall accomplishments as well. Frankly, he [Obama] has done more for the betterment of this country than Reagan did, and he still has a year left. More importantly, the racial complexion of America has changed and putting Obama on the dollar bill really, really helps express that. An official republican response has not been issued, but Reserve leaders are confident that everyone will agree that this is a progressive step forward"	Fake

Then youre going to LOVE this. Great news for President Trump who ran on that great, big beautiful wall to keep the bad ones out. A whole lot less people are crossing the southern border these days.  The number of people illegally crossing the U.S. southern border has dropped 40 percent in President Trumps first full month in office, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said Wednesday. U.S. Customs and Border Patrol reported that the number of illegal border crossings dropped from 31,578 to 18,762 persons. Kelly said border agents usually see a 10 to 20 percent increase in illegal immigrant apprehensions from January to February. The drop in apprehensions shows a marked change in trends, Kelly said. Since the administrations implementation of executive orders to enforce immigration laws, apprehensions and inadmissible activity is trending toward the lowest monthly total in at least the last five years.

" Edward Snowden: Osama Bin Laden is Still Alive Living in the Bahamas http://www.anonjekloy.tk/2017/03/edward-snowden-osama-bin-laden-is-still.html ANON JEKLOY  10:29:00 PM   BREAKINGNEWS  , featured  , hotnewsanonymous Edward Snowden: Osama Bin Laden is Still Alive Living in the Bahamas: Edward Snowden (the NSA whistleblower) has made another astonishing revelation. He apparently has documents that prove Osama Bin Laden is on the CIAs payroll and currently living a luxury lifestyle in the Bahamas.     In 2013, Edward Snowden, a former contractor for the National Security Agency (NSA), released various documents regarding government surveillance programs. This resulted in him being charged for committing several crimes.  All of the charges carry a sentence of up to 10 years in prison. Due to this and the fact he believed it was the correct decision to reveal the shocking extent of phone surveillance by U.S. intelligence agency, he had no choice but to flee. He currently resides in Russia, this is where he has be offered asylum for one year. Snowden has yet again provided a shocking piece of information. The Moscow Tribune reports that Snowden claims that Osama Bin Laden the infamous former leader of Al Qaeda, is in fact still alive and is in receipt of cash courtesy of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). I have documents showing that Bin Laden is still on the CIAs payroll,  Snowden claims. He is still receiving more than $100,000 a month, which are being transferred through some front businesses and organizations, directly to his Nassau bank account. I am not certain where he is now, but in 2013, he was living quietly in his villa with five of his wives and many children. Snowden claims the CIA faked the death of Osama Bin Laden. After reporting him dead, the man himself and his family were moved to a secret location in the Bahamas. Osama Bin Laden was one of the CIAs most efficient operatives for a long time, Snowden claims. What kind of message would it send their other operatives if they were to let the SEALs kill him? They organized his fake death with the collaboration of the Pakistani Secret services, and he simply abandoned his cover. Since everyone believes he is dead, nobodys looking for him, so it was pretty easy to disappear. Without the beard and the military jacket, nobody recognizes him. NaijaPicks say that these documents that prove this controversial claim are featured in his 2015 book. Despite the fact Snowden says he was trying to help the citizens of America by releasing these documents, he is still classed as a fugitive in the USA. This is also despite approximately 168,000 people signing a petition calling for Snowden to be pardoned. This was rejected by the White House rejected on July 28, 2015. Whilst resident in Hong Kong, Snowden was interviewed by several journalists inside a secret location. He was asked why he left his own country, his reply to The Guardian was: I dont want to live in a society that does these sort of things I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded.

" Charlottesville Killer Was Hillary Supporter, Funded By Soros http://yournewswire.com/charlottesville-hillary-soros/ The man accused of being a neo-Nazi and murdering a woman by deliberately driving into her during protests in Charlottesville is in reality a supporter of Hillary Clinton and member of Antifa in receipt of funding by George Soros, according to reports. James Fields, 20, of Maumee, Ohio, allegedly killed Heather Heyer, aged 32, and injured 19 others when he rammed his car into a group of protesters on Saturday in Charlottesville, Virginia. Mainstream media is claiming Fields is a neo-Nazi and has conveniently produced photographs showing Fields standing with Vanguard America and carrying a shield bearing the groups insignia. But the mainstream media is actively suppressing information that proves Fields is actually a left-wing operative at the heart of a false flag designed to spark civil war, introduce martial law, and take away the rights of conservative groups to assemble peacefully. Police were ordered to stand down just before the incident, as confirmed by ACLU. This invited the violence the city used to shut down a court-permitted protest, said Robert Barnes, a high-profile constitutional lawyer. Immediately after the car was driven into the crowd and James Field was identified as the driver and arrested, his social media accounts were put on lockdown and scrubbed of political content. His affiliation to Clinton and the dangerous far-left is being actively suppressed. There is only one winner in Charlottesville. His name is George Soros and he funds Antifa. The UniteTheRight rally was planned months in advance, proper permits were sought and granted, and the peaceful protest was going to plan. Then, due to political pressure from the left, the city of Charlottesville rescinded the permit a few days before the rally. This was a clear violation of the 1st Amendment. So UniteTheRight went to federal court and won. A federal judge ordered that the rally must go on and the rally-goers Constitutional rights be protected. But the left wasnt finished. The Democrat mayor and police department ordered the rally an unlawful assembly, and threatened to arrest everybody  once again, violating 1st and 9th amendment rights. Then things got bloody. George Soross Antifa stepped up to the plate, unleashing chaos and hate as per their job description. The mainstream media is spreading lies and deceit to further the false flag, and attempting to deflect from their transparent agenda by railing angrily against President Trump for failing to say exactly what they want him to say (despite the fact Obama did not disavow Black Lives Matter after they destroyed Ferguson and Baltimore). Real footage captured by citizen journalists on the ground in Charlottesville proves that the mainstream media are peddling lies about the incident from the comfort of their air-conditioned ivory towers. The car crash is a sloppy false flag, designed to mislead, deceive and take away our rights. The following video, around 2 minutes in, shows the crash in real time, and shows Fields car being rammed from behind. The Charlottesville violence is far-left agitation at its worst. It is the culmination of violent rhetoric spewing from the mouths of Hillary Clinton and Loretta Lynch. In cahoots with George Soros, the failed presidential candidate and her cronies are attempting to stage a false flag to take away the rights of conservatives to lawfully organize rallies and assemble peacefully. Chaos and hate the order of the day, as the lawless ones march us towards a police state and a New World Order. While the real terrorists are allowed to roam free, we will be the ones imprisoned."

" DHS Insider: CIA And Mossad Behind Washington DC Pedophile Ring http://www.anonjekloy.tk/2017/02/dhs-insider-cia-and-mossad-behind.html ANON JEKLOY  6:34:00 PM   BREAKINGNEWS  , hotnewsanonymous  [YNW] DHS Insider: CIA And Mossad Behind Washington DC Pedophile Ring: A DHS insider claims that the CIA and Mossad are secretly behind the cover-up of a Washington DC pedophile ring, using their knowledge of politicians involved to blackmail and further their political agendas.  According to a new interview with a Department of Homeland Security agent, over one third of DC politicians are controlled by sexual blackmail, which the CIA and Mossad use to further the Deep States goals.      Theinternationalreporter.org reports: Today, we have an exclusive interview with a special DHS insider who has answered some critical questions we have on PizzaGate.  Our insider prefers to call it PedoGate and what he told us blew our minds! We are so fortunate that members of the Intel community like our work and feel they can trust us. We have been trying to get to the bottom of PizzaGate for months and the answers we got from our DHS insider. Q. So, in the Intelligence community, how chaotic is the atmosphere now?  A. In my 34 years of Governmental service, I have never seen anything like it.  Its the bifurcation of the entire intelligence apparatus. Q. It seems the intel community has it in for Trump  is this your feeling? A. There are many Trump supporters within the FBI.  The CIA, however,  is against Trump because Trump threatens to ruin their game in the middle east. Q. Can you elaborate?  A. CIA and Mossad work in tandem with British intel.  The goal for the CIA was to replace Assad with a puppet and to topple Iran so we could access their oil.  Israel works closely with its sister, Saudi Arabia, to help this dark cause. Q.  So it seems like the intel community has it in for Trump. How can he protect himself? A. Trump has a tremendous opportunity here, but needs to circle wagons. The travel ban included 7 countries chosen by both Jared Kushner and Rudy. Why did it not include Saudi Arabia, or Pakistan, or Turkey or other countries that hate us? The seven nations mentioned were chosen by Israel, thats why. And the unspoken alliance of Israel and Saudi Arabia should be exposed. They are brother and sister. Jared Kushner needs to be careful with what he says and to whom. But, the biggest thing Trump can do is expose PedoGate via Sessions. Big names will go down hard, and it gets the blood suckers drained from the swamp. There are as many pedophiles on the Republican side as there is with democrats, but Trump is in a unique position to truly clean up Dodge, so to speak. I can tell you that what is in Anthony Weiners hard drive, and what videos exist via Jeffery Epstein, WILL BRING massive arrests  in time. Trumps legacy could be truly great if he was to purge the CIA, stop the extortion, prosecute the pedophiles and reinstate the death penalty for pedos convicted a second time.  Pedogate is his path to greatness. Q. How does Russia fit into all this? A.  The CIA and Israel are responsible for the creation of Isis. Isis was created specifically to weaken Iran and destabilize Syria. It worked for awhile until Putin shored up Assad and bolstered Iranian Qud forces. The real reason you see such anti-Russian fever from both Schumer and McCain, Graham and Feinstein, is because the operation has blown up in our faces. Q. Is Israel behind the anti Russian sentiment? A. Yes. Israeli intelligence is furious with Trump, and will do anything to keep Trump from working with Putin.  Understand that if Trump and Putin work together to defeat Isis, they are actually defeating a CIA/Mossad creation, and furthermore, Syria and Iran grow stronger, which the Saudis and the Israelis fear. Their goal was to divide Syria and ultimately destroy Irans regime. It is not just an oil grab, but a much bigger attempt at moving the chess pieces to allow Israel and Saudi Arabia to dominate the entire Middle East. Q. So they demonize Putin and try to tarnish the Trump administration? A. The Deep State is at war with both Trump and Putin. Understand that when Israeli intelligence hears America first from Trump, they go apeshit. Israel has bribed, extorted and intimidated our politicians for decades and suddenly this upstart billionaire threatens to ruin everything. Q. You mention the word extort. Does that relate to Pizzagate? A. PedoGate is only a modern term associated with a long history of Pedo-blackmail connected to both Israel and the Intel community. There is a full court press to stop PedoGate from being looked at because if people knew the true motives behind the pedophilia epidemic, they would do more than march on Washington. They could actually seed a revolution, with the spark coming from decent American parents who want to protect their kids. Our politicians are compromised. The senior analyst nicknamed FBI Anon alluded to this in his exchange with folks on 4chan and with you. Q. What do you mean compromised? A. Do you notice 2 central themes running through the MSM lately?  Those themes are Fear the Russians and #PizzaGate is fake news.  Both tropes come from the same place. Q. Can you explain? A. How do we exert power?  Via fear. Do you ever wonder why both Democrats and Republicans fall all over themselves to kiss up to Israel? Odd, since Israel is the size of Rhode Island The fact is, many of our politicians  on both sides  have been compromised by CIA and Mossad for years. Its actually not admiration they are expressing for Israel, but fear. Notice Lindsay Graham and Chuck Schumer repeating the same salute when it comes to Israel. How does that even happen? The American people are finally seeing that there is no two-party system, but one big shadow Government pretending we have political dichotomy. Q.  So PedoGate is real and they have to get Americans to disbelieve it? A. Let me explain how threatening PedoGate is Who wins? Trump. Putin. Americans. Russians. The world. Who loses? Israel, since they no longer can blackmail our politicians, the same goes for the CIA. The Shadow Government loses. But, the people win. Q. Can you give me specific instances of politicians being compromised by Israel? A. Sure. Lolita Island. Jeffery Epstein, a billionaire convicted of pedophilia received a soft sentence. His island was rigged with video recorders. Many politicians have been compromised. It was a Mossad/CIA operation. Contact ex-senior CIA CCS, Robert David Steele. Bob knows and has even spoken about this with numerous reporters. Q. So an ex-CIA senior agent named Robert Steele is on record saying Epsteins island was a honey trap to lure our most powerful politicians into a extortion scheme? A. Yes. There are videos of some of the most powerful players in the most humiliating positions. If this gets out, not only are the politicians ruined, but the extortion game is over and suddenly, the influence CIA and Mossad wield over Washington, is gone. Q. Wow ! Now its all making sense. A. Yes. lets continue this conversation later. Q. So I checked out Robert David Steele, and he mentions Chuck Schumer being on Lolita Island. So does FBI anon. Is that why Schumer is targeting Trumps cabinet picks? A. Connect the dots. Q. How many other politicians have been secretly extorted? A. One in three, roughly. Its not just the Island, its all of their activities. The reason #Pedogate terrifies the media, the CIA, the Israel Lobby, is because they are all part of this shadow swamp Q. Former CIA agent, Robert Steele, says Mossad operated Lolita Island and CIA worked with them. Thats treason on all levels. A. Yes, and its espionage. Just as these leaks from the intel community regarding Flynn.  I expect that at some later moment, Trump will leak some of these videos Q. Wait. Trump has videos of politicians in delicate situations? A.  No, But the Intel community has them, and Trump has strong support among certain players in the community. Trump has said he wants to throw a spotlight on the cockroaches. Q. But Trump just met with Netanyahu and pledged the usual unbreakable bond with Israel. A. Theatre.  Netanyahu is desperate to both play Trump into attacking Syria,and hate Putin, and to convince him PedoGate is a conspiracy theory. Q. That is what Robert Steele says, as well. So, exposing the Pedophiles diminishes Israels influence in American politics and also changes the map in a critical mass way? A. The same media screaming The Russians are coming is the same media who says Pizzagate is fake news Thats CIA and Mossad talking points. Q. How do social media giants like Facebook and Google fit in? A. Facebook and CIA are literally the same petri-dish. Google became a Deep State organ courtesy of Eric Schmidt. Q. Getting back to the Pedo stuff, FBI anon said in July of last year, that the Clinton Foundation sold secrets to foreign nations. Did they also engage in PizzaGate? A. There are videos of WJC that would destroy him. FBI anon leaked weeks ago, on purpose. There was a reason. Q. Ok, FBI anon gave Schumers initials, and Barnet Frank and others, but so far we have only seen low level arrests. A . FBI anon did a bank shot. Thats a pool hall term we use. Ask Bob about it. FBI Anon rattled their cages as other DHS and local authorities rounded up all sorts of street-level human traffickers. The big arrests will come in time, but first the small fish are interrogated, and provide information that leads to larger fish. FBI Anon was firing a shot across the bow, much like you shake a beehive to infuriate the bees. Notice how blatantly hostile McCain, Schumer, Graham, and others are? It was what we call a targeted trigger. It worked. By long-kniving Flynn, they exposed their hand. Now, Trump has full executive powers to investigate the CIA and Mossad. Notice how there is sound and fury about Russian influence and utter silence on Mossad influence in our power structure? When FBI anon leaked in early July, the whole idea was to expose the Clinton Foundation,and to hint at the sale of people i.e. Pedogate. Look back at his exchange on 4chan. He is a gifted analyst, and knows just what stone to throw at Goliaths noggin. By triggering the shadow Government, he helps citizen journalists ask the right questions and follow the right breadcrumbs, not the rabbit holes the Elite scum want you to follow. Now, PedoGate victims are speaking out on their experiences! You just had a story on some lady who went through having her family abused by California-Deep-State-sponsored terrorism. If folks knew that CPS in California is tied into a huge racket that kidnaps children from parents, they would realize just how sick this is. Foster homes, CPS, etc all get paid well to jail parents and then snatch their kids away. These kids suffer abuse, and perpetuate the growing cancer called pedogate. Politicians who have pedophile tendencies are groomed for power, because they can be later extorted and controlled. Meanwhile, victims have no voice- until now. Suddenly, we have citizen journalism, and it will end up saving the people, in the end. I have to go, but please contact Robert David Steele, the former CIA agent we discussed. I am sure he would appear on your channel. You are providing a real service to the people and we hope you will continue to speak up for the regular folks who are concerned, rightfully, as to the state of our nation.

" JUST IN: Paper Trail Left As Seth Rich Murder Mystery Unveils New Twist https://conservativedailypost.com/just-in-paper-trail-left-as-seth-rich-murder-mystery-unveils-new-twist/ Posted by Sam Di Gangi | Sep 22, 2017 | Liberal Corruption With the exceptions of capitalism, God, and low taxes, there is nothing that Democrats detest more than having to address questions about Seth Rich. That is because the sharpest investigators from the best forensics colleges have detected a cover-up. Signs that the DNC is mired in this guilt all the way up to their neckties and pearl necklaces mean nothing to most liberals who just say, it was proven as fake news. Well, no it certainly was and is not! In fact, a paper trail has unveiled a new twist regarding the whole affair. Disobedient Media tells us today that a report from America First Media Group appears to show that payments were made to a private security company called Crowdstrike and that these ominous payments coincided with the dates of two mysterious deaths. That would be the deaths of Seth Rich (DNC staffer and likely leaker to Wikileaks) as well as process server Shawn Lucas. Many who care about justice remember the name of Rich, but few recall the odd facts surrounding the death of Lucas. He met his end after he attempted to serve former DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz with papers regarding the DNC Fraud Lawsuit. The lawyers for the plaintiffs in that case sought protection from the court by citing both Seth Rich and Shawn Lucas deaths, as well as that of Beranton Whisenant Jr. and others. To put this into perspective, most people have seen crime documentaries where the guilty party says, no comment to questions like did you kill your best friend? There is no doubt of the guilt when such answers are given to such easy questions, and this is basically the analogy that can be used to describe how citing such concerns highlighted this. America First Media Group shows that the first payment made was what they called preemptive measures and occurred on May 5th, 2016. Whoever left his paper trail also later added to that a payment to Crowdstrike that totaled $98,849.84 and that took place on July 11th. The report tells us that the relationship to this date happens to be the day after DNC Data Director of New Voter Registration Seth Rich was murdered. The final payment to date is August 3rd, 2016. This coincides with another murder in the District of Columbia. Shawn Lucas, who died on August 2nd of last year, was the DNC Process Server and close friend of Seth Rich. While libs keep crying fake news and case closed, this paper trail proves that such is simply NOT the case.  While libs keep crying fake news and case closed about the Seth Rich case, this paper trail proves that such is simply NOT the case. Are we seeing evidence of actual blood money RIGHT BEFORE OUR VERY EYES? Lucas and Rich were friends, a fact which must not be overlooked. If one of those two was suspected of telling the other anything that the DNC wanted to be left unsaid, according to the James Bond logic that we seem to be witnessing, they both would have to go. Thanks to the Atlantic Council, George America LAST Soros is tied to Crowdstrike, which is yet another strike against them. Also, Adam Carter has found reasons to suspect the firm as having a possible role in the creation of the Guccifer 2.0 persona and possible fabrication of Russian hacking in coordination with the DNC. This is a lie which has haunted the current White House since day one. What we have here is a rare and vivid look into actual liberal corruption. CrowdStrike-DNC With ties to George Soros vis the Atlantic Group, Crowdstrike already comes with a justified level of distrust. If for any reason anyone on either side of the aisle (love Trump or hate him) still thinks that there is no leftwing cover-up happening here: let us imagine that George W. Bush and his team had such a paper trail after a GOP leaker is murdered who was talking to Jullian Assange about a Republican scheme to steal the White House. Even with the facts that we have now, Bush would have swung from the highest tree that the media could have hung him from. Even if it was only half-true, the media circus would have savored the ratings talking about it nonstop. A PAPER TRAIL OF DEATH FOR BUSH the headlines on CNN would read, would they not have?  THAT is how one knows that there is a cover-up happening.  Sources: Disobedient Media  Teddy Stick"	Fake
" Virginia GOP Rep Turns Traitor, Newest Resolution Helps Muslims As Christians Excluded https://conservativedailypost.com/virginia-gop-rep-turns-traitor-newest-resolution-helps-muslims-as-christians-excluded/ Posted by Danny Abarno | Sep 22, 2017 | National Security Representative Barbara Comstock (R-VA) has proposed a bill that would make hate speech against Islam illegal The United States legislators have continued to follow Europes path towards complete censorship. European lawmakers have long placed laws that forbid the use of hate speech and make the offenses legally extremely punishable. Congress is looking to do the same thing in the United States that would comments against certain minorities legally punishable. Representative Barbara Comstock (R-VA) has proposed a bill that would protect Muslims from Islamophobic comments and she is not alone as many in the House are hoping the bill gets through.  The bill is designed to protect minorities from hate speech, a vague category of crime that seems only to protect minorities while the majority is subject to any criticism. It would not be surprising to find out that this bill would be supported by Democrats, as they make up the majority of support, but there are a few virtue signaling Republicans that think that limiting speech is a good thing.  The Democrats and liberals in the United States have always sought the removal of free speech as it allows forces in control to silence any internal opposition that may be directed against them. Republicans should know better than to advance a bill that would take away someones ability to criticize something, especially a religion.   The rational side of Islam that takes place after free speech is destroyed in a country. If this bill is passed then the US government will enforce Sharia law The rational side of Islam that takes place after free speech is destroyed in a country. If this bill is passed then the US government will enforce Sharia law  The bill also calls for new task forces to be created that would seek out and prosecute individuals who violate the proposed law.  This means that our representatives want to create secret police forces appointed by bureaucrats to carry out laws that prohibit the criticism of Islam. If one begins to think of religious police who come to silence or kill journalists, activists, or anyone who disagrees with Islams culture of domination then one would have the proper idea of the kinds of forces that are going to be appointed.  These task forces already exist in Europe as many in the United Kingdom suffer from their own government prosecuting them simply for stating that child marriage is common in Islam. Child marriage, polygamy, and religious intolerance were not what built this great nation and to have our culture become irrelevant is not only unacceptable, it is treason. These representatives should feel ashamed of themselves for even suggesting religious police forces would be a good idea and somehow does not cross the line between church and state.  By instating government forces to monitor and prosecute hate speech, the US government would be condoning the use of religious police. Saudi Arabian Religious police above are brutal and are able to carry out swift and unjust punishments on the spot.

Saudi Arabian Religious police above are brutal and are able to carry out swift and unjust punishments on the spot. Advertisement    Unfortunately, this bill looks like it was manufactured by Islamist political groups across the United States. These groups like CAIR and the Muslim Brotherhood are huge international organizations with vast networks of associates and activists that work to undermine national governments in order to better establish Sharia law.  They will influence public opinion by calling anyone who speaks ill of Islam an Islamophobic, even though Muslims constantly disrespect and call for the deaths of Jews, Hindus, Christians, and often times other Muslims. If this law is passed then it basically condone Sharia law in the sense that blasphemers can have a legal case brought against them.  Once organizations and police forces across the nation are able to enforce laws against those who speak ill of Islam, it will grant a foothold to those who want other punished by Sharia as well. Citizens of the United States did not immigrate from around the globe just to have Sharia law dominant over their lives.  This is the same Sharia law that oppresses women and religious minorities to conditions that violate all international human rights. This law can never be placed over the Constitution as even the tiniest foothold will allow Islam to spread and begin to control the lives of all Americans.  If the US places Islam above the Constitution then it will allow Islam to punish anyone caught outside of Sharia law. This bill must be stopped. If the US places Islam above the Constitution then it will allow Islam to punish anyone caught outside of Sharia law. This bill must be stopped. America has always placed our most sacred right as the right to speak freely. This often times calls for people to listen to opinions they probably disagree with but nevertheless must be heard the same. It protects the rights of minorities to speak out against atrocities that are occurring as well as allows even the most outrageous political voices to be heard.  It is placed above all other rights for a reason because our founding fathers knew the dangers associated of a religion tied to a government structure. Islam can not be placed above other religions as it will give it a place to legally prosecute any who violate Sharia law, a drastic violation of any Americans Constitutional rights."	Fake
" Hillarys Campaign Appears As If Theyre Backing Out Of The Debate https://conservativedailypost.com/breaking-hillarys-campaign-now-backing-out-of-the-debate/?utm_source=Push&utm_medium=OneSignal&utm_campaign=Martin Posted by Martin Walsh | Sep 21, 2016 | Liberal Corruption, States Rights Sick Hillary Trying To Get Out Of Debate The long awaited presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is set to take place on Monday, September 26, 2016. As many have recognized, Hillarys health is withering away nearly as quickly as her chances of winning this election.  In fact, Hillarys health has gotten so bad lately, she cancelled a major rally she had planned in North Carolina for Tuesday afternoon. Naturally, the Clinton campaign offered no response for why they cancelled an event, but we all know the reason.  Hillary has also canceled several events after she collapsed at Ground Zero on 9/11. The campaign indicated that Hillary overheated, the flu, had pneumonia. She literally has so many illnesses and health problems, it is almost impossible to keep up with which sickness she has this week.  On Saturday night, we all saw how pale, frail, and ghostly Hillary appeared at 10pm when she spoke about the New York City bombings. She appeared absolutely exhausted and unfit to stand strong for a country that desperately needs a leader during these tough times.   Sleepy Hillary Too Tired To Face Trump In Debate Now, it has been reported by associates close to the Clinton campaign that Hillary is attempting to cancel the debate where she is set to face Donald Trump for the first time. She may argue health issues or something else that doesnt make sense, but she is working closely with her team to avoid having to debate in a few days.  The sources argue that Hillary feels as if the game is too close right now, and she is trying to just run out the clock and stay as hidden as possible before Election Day. The sources argue there is simply too much heat on Clinton and she quite possibly is one or two bad stories away from being permanently beaten.  The sources spoke on the terms of anonymity, but they have indicated that they will provide more information when it becomes available. They indicated that they clear her schedule for the rest of the week so that she can rest, but they still are concerned about the fact the Hillary will have to stand for hours during this debate.  They are also trying to push for a seated debate with chairs as opposed to standing. This could get very interesting in the coming days as we monitor the situation.  Whether Hillary participates in the debate or not is a moot point. We can all clearly see the Clinton campaign is literally imploding with under 50 days until the Election. The campaign is running from fire to fire, and they should all blame Hillary for carrying so much baggage, hiding so many lies, and keeping so many things secret.  Things have gotten so bad that even Clintons spokesman cant even come up with answers for her failures. Watch him absolutely crash and burn in this interview from Wednesday morning. How pathetic is this?  Clinton campaign literally starting to implode 48 days out. This is OURS to lose now. pic.twitter.com/q8uRwbuapo   Martin Walsh (@mrwalsh8) September 21, 2016 Hillary has been in public office for 30+ years, she has no one to blame other than herself for her failures.  While we wait to hear from the Clinton campaign, we can clearly see that we are winning this election. The American people are uniting from all walks of life to ensure that this election isnt won by Hillary.  Hillary spent $50,000,000 in August on negative ads against Trump and she still dropped in the polls by 5 percentage points. We are winning this election, but we cannot afford to let go of the lead. We have to continue to share articles and promote Donald Trump. This country needs Trump now more than ever, and the American people across the country are voicing their support.  We are very close to winning the election and ending the Clinton Cartel from ruining this country any longer, but we cannot let up now. We need to win this by as much as possible so they cannot take it away from us.  We will keep you posted whether or not Hillary drops out of the debate Monday, but either way, we can clearly see she is in full panic mode and is afraid to face Doanld Trump!"	Fake
" Does Hillary Clinton Have Kuru Disease From Cannibalism? https://conservativedailypost.com/evidence-hillary-now-confirmed-to-have-kuru-disease-from-cannibalism-proof/ Posted by Elliot Bougis | Nov 9, 2016 | Breaking News The steak tartare was a bad decision.  Here is what we know so far:  First, Hillary Clinton clearly has serious medical problems and is receiving unknown or inexplicable treatments for it.  Dr. Drew, a CNN favorite, had his show cancelled with days of expressing his concerns.  Second, her health problems mainly manifest as speech problems, uncontrollable coughing, or inappropriate laughter, problems walking, and a bizarre tongue ulcer.  Third, she is professionally and personally connected to Marina Abramovic, a bizarre performance artist, and therefore has a surprising number of connections to the occult and to the satanic art/magick ritual known as Spirit Cooking.  Fourth, Spirit Cooking includes disturbing instructions to cut into ones own flesh, eat the pain, and mix bodily fluids like breast milk, urine, blood, semen, and even feces for spiritual drinking.  Fifth, the usual assumption is that she has Parkinsons disease, or might simply be a functioning alcoholic who stumbles and acts out in public.  But there is another possibility.  According to Wikipedia, kuru is a rare, incurable neurodegenerative disorder (aka, brain disease) which was prevalent among the Fore people Papua New Guinea in the 1950s and 60s. Kuru is a type of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, caused by prions, which cause abnormal folding of specific proteins mostly found in the brain. In this respect, kuru is very similar to Creuztfeldt-Jakid Disease (CJD), better known as Mad Cow Disease.  The Rachel Maddow Disease  Dont worry about the medical jargon; the point is that there is a very unpleasant disease called kuru that is transmitted by ingestion of human blood (specifically the prions in the blood). These prions then cause more and more deformities in the brains proteins over time, ultimately leading to death.  #ImWithHer  #ImWither  On the left is a card from the 1990s role-playing game called Illuminati, which is debated to this day because many of its cards seems to predict current events in the Globalist Agenda.  In any case, the term kuru derives from the Fore word kuria or guria (to shake), a reference to the body tremors that are a classic symptom of the disease. It is also known as the laughing sickness due to the pathologic bursts of laughter which are a symptom of the disease. It is now widely accepted that kuru was transmitted among members of the Fore tribe of Papua New Guinea via funerary cannibalism. Kuru causes physiological as well as neurological effects that ultimately lead to death.  Neurological disorders?  Check!  Bodily tremors?  Check!  Laughing fits?  Check!  Ritual consumption of human tissues?  Check!  In the first stage of kuru, victims exhibit unsteady stance and gait, decreased muscle control, tremors, and speech problems.  In the second stage, the patient is incapable of walking without support and suffers ataxia and severe tremors.  Furthermore, the victim is emotionally unstable and depressed, yet has uncontrolled sporadic laughter.  In the final stage, the patient is incapable of sitting without support  suffers severe ataxia, is unable to speak, is incontinent  has speech problems, is unresponsive to his or her surroundings, and develops chronic ulcerated wounds.  A screenshot of Hillarys tongue during the DNC this summer.  A chronic tongue ulcer.  Ultimately, an infected person usually dies within three months to two years after the first symptoms, often because of pneumonia or pressure sore infection.  Pneumonia?  Why, yes, thats exactly the explanation that her campaign gave to the public after she froze up and collapsed in New York on 9/11!  Heres one other visual oddity.  An illustration of prions in action, causing tangled protein deformities.   Am I only one this prion illustration reminds of a presidential candidates logo?  Or, as one journalist noticed last year  Cant spell Hillary without ill!  In pop culture, the zombie apocalypse in the video game Dead Island is blamed on an aggressive type of kuru that causes skin degeneration as well as psychotic rage.  Ironically enough, some years ago, Hillary herself noted the connection between violent video games and cannibalism.  Is any of this 100% conclusive? No, I admit that, of course. But it does remind us of two bits of wisdom.  First, the outside gradually comes to reflect the inside of a person. Over time, our thoughts and our habits express themselvesimpose themselveson our physical appearance and health. So if a person is filled with lies and dark thoughts for decades, it will manifest in her appearance. An internally corruptor rottenperson will inevitably show external, bodily corruption, as well.  Second, we can run from our actions for a long time, but eventually the consequences catch up with us. If Hillary ever had ingested the ingredients in Spirit Cooking, not even she is above the law of consequences.  If nothing else, we as American should NOT elect someone with this many spiritual and medical problems.  We must be wiser.  We must elect Donald Trump to Make America Great Again!"	Fake
" Head Official Makes FINAL CALL, Hillary Most Definitely Sick With THIS https://conservativedailypost.com/head-official-makes-final-call-hillary-most-definitely-sick-with-this/ Posted by Matthew Bernstein | Sep 15, 2016 | Liberal Corruption Hillarys Diagnosis Is Interesting Hillary Clintons health scares have been extremely prevalent the past couple days. Even though the Clinton campaign has stated that she has pneumonia, there are people that think otherwise. In fact there is a claim that she might have Parkinsons disease.  A Republican state representative for New Hampshire made the claim first, on his Facebook account. In fact there was a twitter post by a King Robbo that has evidence to this. JUST BEFORE SHE COLLAPSED! Her aid asks her to Squeeze My Fingers A neurological test! NOT PNEUMONIA!   Now there is more evidence for this. Daniel Tamburello, the co-chair of the Veterans For Trump group, has explained that his father had Parkinsons and pneumonia is common for people who suffer from it.  They may have admitted HRC has pneumonia, but thats not WHY she has pneumonia. I believe she has pneumonia caused by Parkinsons disease.   Hillary Clinton delivers the keynote address at the 18th Annual David N. Dinkins Leadership and Public Policy Forum at Columbia University, in New York, April 29, 2015. AFP PHOTO/TREVOR COLLENS (Photo credit should read TREVOR COLLENS/AFP/Getty Images) There Are Many People That Believe That Hillary Clinton Might Have Parkinsons Disease Temburello created a Facebook post detailed what he knows about the disease.  My Dad has had Parkinsons since 1989, so I know a bit about the disease. Hillary has been rumored to have Parkinsons for some time, as one of the theories to what ails her. (Personally I would surmise it is more than one illness).  While not as educated as a doctor, Tamburello has probably talked to doctors over the past 25 plus years, so he does know what to suspect. Since it was a loved one that has had it, you can be assured that Tamburello is going to pay special attention.  It has now been admitted she has pneumonia. Pneumonia is one of the most common secondary conditions that occurs, and is a high degree secondary issue complicating Parkinsons patients health that causes eventual mortality  again, very common to have Parkinsons patients die of pneumonia.  Top Dems Working To Talk Clinton Into Resigning  Clinton Has Pneumonia Which Is A Common Secondary Condition From Having Parkinsons Disease Since he has been dealing with a family member having Parkinsons for over 25 years, he has probably heard all of this before. Again even though he is not a doctor, he probably has paid close attention to what has been said to him.  Why do a lot of people who have Parkinsons die of pneumonia? Well Tamburello answers that as well. The reason is a lack of being able to control the valve on your throat that prevents water from going into your lungs when drinking.  Everyone has experienced this before. When you drink something and then suddenly start coughing and hacking, it is usually because you tried to take a breath at the same time that you were swallowing. Most people refer to this as going down the wrong pipe.  Tamburello continues on in his post. This in a combination with the recent fondness of mumus, makes me think she is concealing a deep brain stim battery pack that counters her tremors from Parkinsons (my dad has this battery pack too).  Well that would explain why you never see Clinton shaking, if she does have this. After all that is one of the more noticeable symptoms of Parkinsons disease is the shaking.  I Think We Know Who Was Behind This You Never See Clinton Shaking, And There Could Be A Reason For That Advertisement  Tamburello finished his post by saying, They may have admitted HRC has pneumonia, but thats not WHY she has pneumonia. I believe she has pneumonia caused by Parkinsons disease.  He offers some evidence, and it could be a reasonable claim. However it appears that his Facebook post was removed. Why would it be removed? Well there are two basic options on why that would happen. The first reason is that it could be true and they dont want people knowing, and the second reason is that Facebook is actively doing what it can to censor any and all anti-Clinton posts.  Facebook has a history of trying to censor right wing ideas. After all their trending news team was fired because of that specific reason.  Facebook Has A History Of Censoring Conservative News, Especially In The Trending News Area Well there is more evidence for the first case. After Tamburello put his post on Facebook, people on Twitter started looking at the footage of Clintons collapse. And they started supporting his claim. Some of the users pointed out that her doctor did the squeeze my fingers test.  This specific test is a common way to determine neurological health. And furthermore, they use it to diagnose Parkinsons disease. So all this evidence is going around that supports the claim that Clinton might have Parkinsons disease.  Now naturally her personal doctor had released a statement that denied these claims. Secretary Clinton has been experiencing a cough related to allergies. On Friday, during follow up evaluation of her prolonged cough, she was diagnosed with pneumonia. She was put on antibiotics, and advised to rest and modify her schedule. While at this mornings event, she became overheated and dehydrated. I have just examined her and she is now re-hydrated and recovering nicely.  Well of course her doctor is going to say that. But it still doesnt answer why someone who was helping her was telling her to squeeze my hand. And considering that the squeeze my fingers test is a common way to diagnose the disease, people are going to become very suspicious.  Hillary Knows She Is Guilty, Time To Put Her Away There Is A Lot Of Evidence In The Theory That Clinton Might Have Parkinsons Disease People were already wondering about Clintons health since she had failed to tell everyone that she had pneumonia in the first place. This is only going to pester her some more until she actually releases her medical records.  Share this article to show that the democratic presidential nominee might actually have Parkinsons disease. With all the evidence that someone who has seen and dealt with the disease for over 25 years, and considering that someone who was there told her to squeeze my fingers, which is a common neurological test, it isnt completely out of the question to say that she has it."

" BREAKING: NFL FINES PITTSBURGH STEELERS $1M EACH FOR SKIPPING NATIONAL ANTHEM http://globalpoliticsnow.com/breaking-nfl-fines-pittsburgh-steelers-1m-skipping-national-anthem/ Donald Trump must have really gotten through to the NFL! After he tweeted on Sunday shaming owners for catering to PC culture while allowing players to disrespect our flag, our country, and our national anthem, everyone fell in line. The Pittsburgh Steelers thought it would be safe to take taking a knee to a whole new level by hiding in the locker room while the National Anthem played and everyone elseABC showed reverence for OUR country but they didnt count on it being extremely costly. reports that: The entire Pittsburgh Steelers team did not participate in the national anthem ceremony prior to their game with the Chicago Bears this afternoon. As the Star-Spangled Banner played at Soldier Field in Chicago at the start of the game at noon local time, the Steelers sideline was virtually empty. Steelers coach Mike Tomlin told a CBS Sports reporter that his team would stay in the locker room during the anthem. Were not participating in the anthem today, Tomlin said, adding that the action was not to be disrespectful to the anthem but to remove the team from this circumstance. People shouldnt have to choose whether to kneel or stand during the anthem, he said. If a guy feels a need to do something he should not be separated from his teammate who chooses not to. So were not participating today, he said. Thats our decision. It was a bad decision. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who donated to Donald Trumps election campaign, announced shortly after the game began that every player who protested the National Anthem and showed immense disrespect to our nation would be fined a cool million dollars. Its one thing to protest, its another thing to be blatantly disrespectful to those who have served our country, Goodell said, noting that this absolutely should not have happened on Veteran Appreciation Day at Heinz Field. Goodell says that going forward, the National Anthem will be a time of reverence, and players will be required to treat it as such. The NFL has acted disgracefully recently, but as usual Donald Trump (and America) wins."	Fake
" Celebrities To Make 'Total Hollywood Strike' Unless Trump Resigns https://www.clear-politics.com/2017/07/27/celebrities-make-total-hollywood-strike-unless-trump-resigns/ We are all well aware that most of the Hollywood stars support the liberals and hate Donald Trump. Even before he took the office, it was more than obvious, as some even said that they will leave the country rather than have Donald Trump as a President. Just one of their hilarious acts.  And lately, they are threatening to make a massive, all-around Hollywood strike if President Donald Trump does not quit. They have described Hollywood as the base of the entire modern American culture, and claim to be representing all of the humanity.  Its about time people understood that were the ones with the power and that the president is there to serve us, not the other way around,  stated a spokesperson.  Were calling for a general strike that would include every single person involved in making motion pictures in Hollywood, starting with the actors and celebrities themselves and encompassing companies in charge of making props, movie memorabilia and even souvenir shops.  Rosie ODonnell, Debra Messing, Ed Asner and Michael Shannon are among the most assertive people who are supporting the idea and calling the people to protest.  No! In the Name of Humanity We Refuse to Accept a Fascist America! reads a full-page ad placed in the New York Times on Wednesday by the group Refuse Racism. Donald Trump, the President-elect, is assembling a regime of grave danger, the ad says.  Millions of people in the US and around the world are filled with deep anxiety, fear, and disgust.Our anguish is right and just. our anger must now become massive resistance  before Donald Trump is inaugurated and has the full reins of power in his hands.   UConservative informs that some of the celebrities are calling for an all-out strike.  Hollywood is, simply put, the base of the entire modern American culture. It is the foundation of the country, so to speak, the glue thats holding it together. And think about what happens when you destroy the foundation of a house. It comes crashing down, right?  Well, thats exactly whats going to happen to America unless Donald Trump realizes how real the danger of that actually is, and chooses to step down as President of his own free will. And while were on the subject, between you and me  nobody wants Hollywood to stop doing its thing, but this is a necessary move.  Besides, its not like the billionaire-businessman-turned-president hasnt ventured into movies in his day, right? So, hell understand firsthand whats going to happen if Hollywood goes to strike. Without the work of Hollywood and the lifestyle promoted by it, there will literally be no more America to rule for Trump. So, in effect, its not us that are going to force Donald Trump to resign his office; its the people of America who are going to make him do it, because the Gods honest truth is  without Hollywood, there is no America. Its like trying to run Nazi Germany without Hitler at the forefront  it just becomes pointless, the spokesperson summed up."	Fake

By the way, all this shit about the DNC, where the hack, it wasnt hacked  He [Rich] offered a sample, an extensive sample, Im sure dozens of emails, and said I want money.

Thats in the FBI report. He also let people know with whom he was dealing  the word was passed, according to the FBI report, I also shared this box with a couple of friends, so if anything happens to me, its not going to solve your problem. But WikiLeaks got access, before he was killed. I have a narrative of how that whole fucking thing began.   Its a [former CIA director John] Brennan operation.

" Klaus Eberwein Who Was Supposed To Testify Against Clintons Found Dead https://www.clear-politics.com/2017/07/17/klaus-eberwein-who-was-supposed-to-testify-against-clintons-found-dead/ The Clintons have become known for having a long list of people who died from unknown reasons under suspicious conditions, and were at the same time, either dangerously connected to them, or representing a threat to them. From recently, sadly, the list has one more name on it.  According to Infowars, an ex-Haitian government representative who was supposed to reveal more on Clinton Foundation fraud and violation during the following week was discovered dead in Miami, and as already mentioned, under suspicious circumstances. When he was found dead, Klaus Eberwein had only 50 years.  The editorial reports that the reason of the death is a gunshot to the head and this case is officially considered a suicide. Eberwein had stated that he feared for his life as he was louder regarding the illegal and unconstitutional things which were happening in the Clinton Foundation.  The Clinton Foundation, they are criminals, they are thieves, they are liars, they are a disgrace, -he stated while protesting in front of Clinton Foundations Manhattan office previous year. This Tuesday, Eberwein was expected to testify in front of the Haitian Senate Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission. In the testimony, he was supposed to show how the Clinton Foundation funneled funds raised in a form of Haiti earthquake donations from donors from all around the world.  His relatives, the close family, and his friends all agreed that he would not commit a suicide.  Its really shocking. We grew up together; he was like family,  stated Gilbert Bailly, Eberweins friend."	Fake
" Bill Clintons Health Condition Update https://www.clear-politics.com/2017/04/29/bill-clintons-health-condition-update/ According to some sources close to the Clinton family, Bill Clinton is facing some tough situations that are going to make his next week very hard.  It looks like his family and some members of the Rodham clan have been filing into Little Rock all week where Bill is being bedridden at the residence connected with his library.  Authors Darwin Porter and Danforth prince expose some pretty big stuff in an article in The Political Insider. It goes like this:  In their new book, Bill & Hillary: So this is that thing called love, the authors interview Clinton insiders who claim that Bill slept with so many women that Hillary Clinton has repeatedly forced him to get an HIV test from the doctor. This is because the former President favored unprotected sex.  And while the first tests came back negative, HIV and AIDS might explain an ongoing mystery. Over the years, both Clintons have kept their medical records a secret. Clinton has explained his rapidly changing appearance to his heart surgery and new diet but he has looked increasingly thin and weak at Hillary campaign rallies.  If they are booking for rooms the only logical explanation is that are preparing themselves to have to stay for a funeral. This family stated that they do not want any state burial or national ceremony if anything happens to both of them in the time when Trump is president as they fear of what Trump is going to say during the process. One spokesman for the Clinton family said:  Donald Trump is mean and vindictive. If something were to happen to one of the Clintons, he could demand to speak at a national service and who knows what kind of disrespect would come out of his childish mouth."	Fake
" MIT Researchers: Global Warming Data Is Complete Bunk http://yournewswire.com/mit-global-warming-data-bunk/ A new peer reviewed report on global warming concludes that key data relied upon to give us temperature measurements around the world is complete bunk. According to scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), key metrics such as the Global Average Surface Temperature (GAST), the NOAA, and HADLEY confirms what Trump has been saying for years  that man-made global warming does not exist. SHFTPlan reports: In this research report, the most important surface data adjustment issues are identified and past changes in the previously reported historical data are quantified. It was found that each new version of GAST has nearly always exhibited a steeper warming linear trend over its entire history. And, it was nearly always accomplished by systematically removing the previously existing cyclical temperature pattern. This was true for all three entities providing GAST data measurement, NOAA, NASA and Hadley CRU. As a result, this research sought to validate the current estimates of GAST using the best available relevant data. This included the best documented and understood data sets from the U.S. and elsewhere as well as global data from satellites that provide far more extensive global coverage and are not contaminated by bad siting and urbanization impacts. Satellite data integrity also benefits from having cross checks with Balloon data. The conclusive findings of this research are that the three GAST data sets are not a valid representation of reality. In fact, the magnitude of their historical data adjustments, that removed their cyclical temperature patterns, are totally inconsistent with published and credible U.S. and other temperature data. Thus, it is impossible to conclude from the three published GAST data sets that recent years have been the warmest ever despite current claims of record setting warming. Finally, since GAST data set validity is a necessary condition for EPAs GHG/CO2 Endangerment Finding, it too is invalidated by these research findings. (Full Abstract Report) Thegatewaypundit.com reports: Fulfilling a key campaign promise, President Trump shocked the world by pulling out of the Paris agreement. Axios Johnathan Swan was the first to report the President would pull out of the agreement. On May 31st, Axios reported: President Trump has made his decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the decision. Details on how the withdrawal will be executed are being worked out by a small team including EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. Theyre deciding on whether to initiate a full, formal withdrawal  which could take 3 years  or exit the underlying United Nations climate change treaty, which would be faster but more extreme. Why this matters: Pulling out of Paris is the biggest thing Trump could do to unravel Obamas climate legacy. It sends a combative signal to the rest of the world that America doesnt prioritize climate change and threatens to unravel the ambition of the entire deal. The other outliers: The only other two countries that arent supporting the deal are Nicaragua and Syria. How it happened: A letter from 22 Republican Senators (including Mitch McConnell) that called for a clean exit had reinforced Trumps instincts to withdraw, and the president had been telling confidants over the past week that he was going to pull out. Its no surprise that members of the liberal establishment shifted into meltdown mode following the decision, with Hollywood director Michael Moore and former President Obama being the most vocal. As per The Hill: Liberal filmmaker Michael Moore blasted President Trumps decision Thursday to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement, calling it a crime against humanity. This admitted predator has now expanded his predatory acts to the entire planet, Moore tweeted. USA to Earth: F YOU, the filmmaker added in other tweets. America First! Earth Last! My name is Michael Moore. I am an American. And I live in a Rogue State. Obamas statement was as follows: A year and a half ago, the world came together in Paris around the first-ever global agreement to set the world on a low-carbon course and protect the world we leave to our children. It was steady, principled American leadership on the world stage that made that achievement possible.  It was bold American ambition that encouraged dozens of other nations to set their sights higher as well. And what made that leadership and ambition possible was Americas private innovation and public investment in growing industries like wind and solar  industries that created some of the fastest new streams of good-paying jobs in recent years, and contributed to the longest streak of job creation in our history. Simply put, the private sector already chose a low-carbon future.  And for the nations that committed themselves to that future, the Paris Agreement opened the floodgates for businesses, scientists, and engineers to unleash high-tech, low-carbon investment and innovation on an unprecedented scale. The nations that remain in the Paris Agreement will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created.  I believe the United States of America should be at the front of the pack.  But even in the absence of American leadership; even as this Administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; Im confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet weve got. But of course, like all Champagne Socialists, their credo is do as I say, not as I do, with Obama jacking up his carbon footprint when abroad. Who could forget Obamas massive convoy during a recent speaking gig in Milan? The Independent Journal Review reported: Former President Barack Obama traveled to Italy this week to make a speech on climate change at the Seed & Chips: The Global Food Innovation Summit in the city of Milan. It seems like Obama has taken a page out of Leonardo DiCaprios book of do as I say, not as I do and took a private jet to Milan. Not only that, he had a 14 car convoy to get into the city, which also included protection from above with a helicopter. It doesnt end there. According to The Daily Mail, 300 police officers were used to protect the former president. The fleet of 14 included multiple SUVs, police cars, and sedans  not to mention a few motorcycles. Heres another look at the convoy: While in Milan, Obama also met with former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who was a close partner during their respective times in office."	Fake
" New Financial Scandal Leads To James Comey https://www.clear-politics.com/2017/06/08/new-financial-scandal-leads-james-comey/ According to the newest evidence, James Comey was appointed as the director of the FBI, by former President Barack Obama, only because he wants to hide the corruption of the Clinton family.  Comeys brother, Peter who works as an executive at the law firm which is responsible for the filling of the Clinton Foundation taxes is maybe the most obvious proof of the connection between Comey and the former First Family.  Obama has the whole trust in Comey that he will not target the deep state that he himself is a part of and that is going according to plan.  The Federalist Tribune reported that:  Comey was the deputy special counsel for the Senate committee investigating the Whitewater scandal in 1996, in which many people were arrested and charged with over 40 crimes, but the Clintons were not. Comey decided he would not prosecute Hillary, even though he acknowledged that she obstructed the investigation and destroyed evidence. Since that, for 23 years he has been repeating the same and he has been rewarded handsomely for enforcing a two  tiered justice system where the political elite live free from consequence. In 2005 he was hired as the General Counsel for Lockheed Martin  the largest recipient of contracts from the Department of Defense. Comey received over $6 million before leaving the corporation in 2010.   Right after this, Comey was hired as a partner of the Clinton Global Initiative and received around 17 contracts from the State Department at the time when Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State.  It is more than clear that Comeys career consists of giving to receive relationships with every person he had contact with. Especially the giant corporations and the globalist political elite. Donald Trump did a good thing by removing him from his position."	Fake

" TRUMP IS VINDICATED: RIGGED Poll Plans Found In Podesta Emails http://dcgazette.com/2016/rigged-poll-plans-found-podesta-emails/  Donald Trump says that the election system is rigged.  Guess what.  Hes right.  In the battle for the mind of the American voter, not much is used more often than polls.  When building up a winner, it is vital to make it LOOK like one side or the other is winning.  No one wants to be associated with a loser, so part of the publicity strategy is to create the image that one side or the other is winning or losing.  In order to make it look like Democrats, in particular, are winning, the coalition of people that includes John Podesta and his tribe of Hillary Helpers came up with a way to make the polls, at least, appear to have their candidates up.  Its called oversampling, and the method is used to plump up percentages.  From Zero Hedge via The Gateway Pundit.  For all of you out there who still arent convinced that the polls are adjusted, we present to you the following Podesta email, leaked earlier today, that conveniently spells out, in detail, exactly how to manufacture the desired data. The email starts out with a request for recommendations on oversamples for polling in order to maximize what we get out of our media polling.  I also want to get your Atlas folks to recommend oversamples for our polling before we start in February. By market, regions, etc. I want to get this all compiled into one set of recommendations so we can maximize what we get out of our media polling. That particular email is accompanied by a guide that tells of specific over sampling strategies PER STATE.  For example, in Florida, sampling first happens in Orlando and Tampa where the people are more friendly to Democrats.  Arizona oversamples with Hispanics.  The idea is to make the candidate more popular than he or she really is.  Reverse strategies are used to bring down the opponent.  Sneaky, huh?  The Podesta emails have been a revelation, but also have proven so many people correct when we looked at the polls and then empirical evidence in the way of crowd size and concluded that there was no way they could both be right.  The battle is on for your mind, and polls are being used as a weapon in that war.  Dont fall for it."	Fake
" VOTER FRAUD: Texas On The Hunt For MASSIVE Vote Harvesting Operation http://dcgazette.com/2016/voter-fraud-texas-on-the-hunt-for-massive-vote-harvesting-operation/  For over a year, the Attorney Generals office in the state of Texas has been conducting what is believed to be the most massive voter fraud scheme investigation in the history of the state.  The ground game portion of the probe is now moving through Dallass sister city, Fort Worth, in search of answers.   The way the scheme supposedly worked was rather devious:  Soft-spoken, middle aged sorts of women were recruited to go door to door with previously filled out ballots with fraudulent voter information. Knocking at the residences of the elderly, the poor, and those who do not know English as a first language, etc., the ladies then would ask leading questions that sounded good, or were collecting signatures for a good cause. (Minority harvesters were hired in minority neighborhoods.) The people targeted, then, would sign a mail in ballot that was all filled out for them, and VIOLA! a vote was harvested. In other cases, the harvesters will appear with the citizens ballot and ask if they need any help filling it out. As they already have the voters historical voting record, they will say something like, You normally vote all Democrat, right?  even thought it is usually a democrat primary or non partisan municipal elections which they are helping them with and proceed to fill out the ballot as desired by the perpetrators. According to the Townhall report which largely depends on the word of an anonymous source, the on the ground investigation is only happening in one county in Texas.  However the full scope of the inquiry is supposedly several times larger and involves multiple elections in the last several years, including utility personnel.  At present, only Tarrant County is involved in the investigation. However, the case allegedly includes vote harvesting for all elected offices, from Congressional seats down to constable.  Particularly intriguing is that this includes elected seats for the Tarrant Regional Water District. This reporter filed stories in 2013 and 2014 regarding corruption and eminent domain abuse at the TRWD. In the most recent election cycle, incumbent candidates Jim Lane and Marty Leonard were re-elected in a landslide that so contradicted polls, that some observers insisted that fraud had to be involved. Hmm.  Where have we heard that before?  It is believed that the money source for this voter harvesting scheme is known to the Attorney General in Texas as well as who is directing the scheme.  Violations of this sort carry a $4,000 fine in Texas and are felonies after being caught twice.  The implications of this investigation, however, are far-reaching. Given the relative ease with which the alleged fraud took place, the possibility that similar operations occur all over the country  including for national elections  only serves to demonstrate the systemic problems that exist in the U.S. voting system. Early voting, mail-in ballots, and absentee ballots create opportunity for widespread fraud, bolstering the case for the a national voting standards, including voter ID verification. And paper ballots.  Dont forget those."	Fake
" Clinton Green Screen Again In NC  Points, Waves To Blank Wall, Not On Cell Phones http://dcgazette.com/2016/clinton-green-screen-nc-points-waves-blank-wall-not-cell-phones/  Since Hillary Clinton is at risk of a campaign-ending health issue manifesting itself in public every time she gets out of her safe-space, the cocoon of her Secret Service and the van shes hauled around in, shes taking precautions. Just as she did in Reno a couple of weeks ago, Clinton has enlisted the use of a green screen to fake the appearance of a crowd and the different backgrounds of a highly manipulated manifestation.  Her natural instincts lean towards deception so for her there are no integrity issues to contend with, just the usual ones of not getting caught in the middle of a lie, or having another couple of lies prepared for when the first ones are discovered.  Her audience, wherever they are, are not in the same location as the liar who wants to be president. Just as in Reno, its clear that the displays on the cell phone screens do not depict the same background or the candidate as she passes in front of them.  There is that old adage about vampires or witches not showing up in mirrors. Perhaps since Mrs. Clinton is both shes having that same effect on cell phone displays. That doesnt explain her strange behavior, turning around an waving to a blank wall, now adorned with the familiar red and white vertical stripes. She even does one of the convulsion-evoking open-mouthed points that both her and her husband regularly perform as a way of recognizing the adoring peasants in attendance.  The wall probably wasnt too impressed with the recognition it got. Clinton clearly didnt understand where the fake audience was going to be later inserted and she couldnt just be cropped out. People might think she had collapsed or had one of her coughing fits. They left it in and it was noticed.  Shes going to discovered no matter how she tries to hide it, what type of deception she tries to employee. Although there arent many folks attending her rallies, thankfully the ones that do, or the ones that are made to appear that they do, brought their cell phones.  Look for future fabricated events to be phone-free, for the safety of the audience, or whatever kind of justification they come up with to protect their flawed candidate from exposure. Maybe phones are a source of dehydration now, cant have them around this frail little jewel, can we?"	Fake
" Another Obama Iran Lie  Ransom Full $1.7 Billion, Half Before Release, Half After http://dcgazette.com/2016/another-obama-iran-lie-ransom-full-1-7-billion-half-release-half/  Theres a reason why the Obama regime had problems with specifics on the balance of $1.3 billion what they said was paid to Iran after the original $400 million ransom had been paid. Thats because the ransom story, as with everything else the Democrats, particularly Obama and Clinton say, looks much less like the truth and a lot more like an attempt at a cover up.  We were told by Obama, Kerry and State Department Spokesman Kirby that the $400 million was not a ransom. It was an assertion which they later were forced to admit was a lie. Now the lie about the ransom lie, that was part of the greater Iran deal lie turns out to have also been  a lie.  The later payment didnt exist because the original ransom was for the full amount, all $1.7 billion of terrorist mad money was paid in exchange for the four hostages.  The regime admitted to Congress on Tuesday that the money laundering styled cash transfer to Iran consisted of $1.7  billion which was arranged through Swiss banks and delivered by the US to Tehran.  Representatives of the State, Defense and Treasury Departments held the private briefing to congressional staff who entered the meeting believing they were simply being updated regarding the $400 million. The original $400 million payment for hostages exchange was conducted on January 17th.  We are now learning that also on the 17th, as well as January 19th and 22nd, money was sent to Iran by way of Swiss bank accounts. So half of the $1.7 billion, it would appear, was paid up front and the other half soon after their release, within five days.  Briefers admitted, The cash payments were four times what has been disclosed and they went through Swiss banks on their way to the Iranians, and indicated that the cash payments were made because Iran was desperate for foreign currency after years of Western sanctions.  According to one source, They said the payments needed to be viewed in the political context. First the Iranian nuclear deal was going through, second the Iranian economy was in a difficult state and third the Iranians were in need of foreign currency.  The source also noted the briefers use of the Clinton strategy, citing an inability to remember when asked who requested the cash."	Fake
" Big Money Went To Valerie Jarretts Homeland In Last Year Of Obama Dictatorship http://dcgazette.com/2016/big-money-went-valerie-jarretts-homeland-last-year-obama-dictatorship/  After playing a clip of State Department spokesman John Kirby admitting that the $400 million ransom paid to the Iranians was contingent upon the imminent release of the four American hostages, Jake Tapper tells Senator Dianne Feinstein that a lot of people would look at that and see what transpired as being a ransom payment.  Feinstein, the liberal who represents the State of California with such integrity, sets about the task of distorting the English language as she usually does. She begins by blaming the fact that there are campaigns being waged as having an impact on the meaning of the word ransom.  She continues, Misconstruing what somebody says particularly if theyre a part of the administration has become an art form of this campaign. She doesnt say whose comments were misconstrued or in what manner, shes a liberal, bestowed with the liberal medias favored political class exemption. No supporting evidence for her wild claims is required. Shes trying to diminish the significance that her party leadership is mired in one lie after another, and the fact that they had to admit to this one, as well as the fact that they deviated from the no ransom policy in providing a lot of money to Valerie Jarretts home country.  Feinstein says, The facts are clear. This was a negotiation over a 1979 sale. This is Iranian money that was frozen. The agreement was that the four hundred million be returned to Iran. Now, Iran was going to release hostages that we very much liked released. Would we send them the money before theyre released or after theyre released?  I ask for your judgment. I know what I would do; it would be after they are released. And thats exactly what the administration did and I think its very much the right thing.  No, Feinstein, the right thing would have been to have demanded their release in advance of any nuclear negotiations. The right thing would have been to penalize Iran for taking our Americans hostage back in 1979, which happens to be when the money was frozen by never returning it. The right thing would have been not to give away $150 billion more and hand Iran a permission slip for their conventional arms buildup and their nuclear program. The right thing would have been not to turn our backs on our allies and make a sweetheart deal with Valerie Jarretts homeland terrorist regime.  But that isnt how our dictator operates. He rewards Islamic extremism and does whatever Valerie tells him to in order to keep her happy. And you, Mrs. Feinstein, are as dishonest and as anti-American as they are. If you think what we did was the right thing, its most certainly wrong."	Fake
" Trump allowed Black homeless woman to live in Trump Tower for 8 years, rent free http://www.naturalnews.com/2016-12-13-trump-allowed-black-homeless-woman-to-live-in-trump-tower-for-8-years-rent-free.html  (Natural News) Donald Trump allegedly invited a homeless black woman to stay at Trump Tower after she was found squatting in the building. Although the story is still unconfirmed, this is just one of many instances where Trump has helped the less fortunate regardless of race or gender. The mainstream media are usually busy portraying Trump as a racist, bigot, or chauvinist. But Trump boasts a long and documented history of helping out  because its the right thing to do.  The homeless black woman reveals that, for eight years, she has been living in the Trump Tower for free. She says that she originally trespassed her way in before squatting in an empty room for the night. Police arrived the next day to address the situation. She was told she must leave the premises  or she would be subject to arrest.  When I told them I would not go, they contacted Mr. Trump over the phone and he came down here. Instead of evicting me off the property, he said that I can stay and its been eight years Ive been here, she revealed. Not only did he not evict me off the property, he made sure that I ate three meals a day by room service and that I get a delivery of fresh flowers every week.  The woman goes on to express a great displeasure with the way the media portrays Trump as a bad person. She insists that if it werent for Trumps generosity she would be homeless, in the streets, and most likely dead. The woman was never asked to pay a dime throughout the duration of her stay at the tower. Donald Trump is not a bad guy, hes a wonderful wonderful man, and everything Im telling you today is true, she concludes.  Trump treated his female employees very well  Trumps female employees believe he is a champion of women as well as the less fortunate. Many of those who worked closely with trump say he was far ahead of his time for providing career advancement for women. Trumps companies have promoted women in otherwise male-dominated industries, granting them entry into a new playing field.  Trump often told the female employees he worked with that he values women who can stand their ground in both legal battles, and on construction sites. Barbara Res was in charge of the Trump Towers 1980 construction. She recalls Trump telling the female employees that men are better than women, but a good woman is better than 10 good men.

" New EPA rules will cost Americans $3,080 each http://www.naturalnews.com/2016-12-08-new-epa-rules-will-cost-americans-3080-each.html  (Natural News) New EPA rules are being implemented on heavy trucks which has boosted the 10-year regulatory burden on America past the $1 trillion mark. 75 percent of that cost was imposed by the Obama administration. New analysis from American Action Forum shows that the cost amounts to an annual cost of $540 per person, or a one-time charge of $3,080.  In other words, each year every person, regardless of age, in the nation is responsible for paying roughly $540 in regulatory costs. These burdens might take the form of higher prices, fewer jobs, or reduced wages, said AAFs Sam Batkins, director of regulatory policy at the watchdog group.  President Obama is scrambling to lock in several new environmental regulations prior to leaving office. Obama has shattered the record for the amount of regulations and added red tape this year, and he still has time to impose many more before leaving office. The staggering amount of money he is costing America is likely to surge even higher. The implementation of new fuel standards for trucks resulted in the new high regulatory costs.  Batkins study dates back to 2005, when George W Bush held the oval office. He said that the Obama administration is responsible for about three-quarters of the added regulatory costs. The Obama Administration surpassed 500 major regulations last summer, imposing $625 billion in cumulative costs. Earlier this year, regulators published the administrations 600th major rule, increasing burdens to $743 billion. Now, thanks to data from the last term of the Bush Administration and another billion-dollar rule from EPA, the regulatory tally has surpassed $1 trillion. These figures are direct estimates from federal regulators, but it will take more than an effort from these regulators to amend hundreds of major regulations. Congress, the next president, and even the courts must participate in the next generation of regulatory modernization.  The EPA wants to make it very difficult for the Trump administration to align fuel economy standards with the needs and expectations of Americans. EPA administrator Gina McCarthy has urged the agencys employees to quickly finish as many rules as possible before Obama leaves the White House. The EPA reported last month that automakers exceeded fuel efficiency standards in new cars, but were unhappy with the agencys early release of its fuel efficiency study.  Donald Trump has promised to kill more regulations then he will add while he is in office. Hopefully his administration will kill many of the regulatory burdens created by Obama.

" Hillary Clinton video: THE WALKING DEAD... collapses into security van... 'medical event'... diagnosed with 'vascular dementia' and Parkinson's... 'one year left to live' says doctor http://www.naturalnews.com/055254_Hillary_Clinton_walking_dead_medical_event.html  (NaturalNews) Hillary Clinton's deplorable health may be far worse than we're being told. A shocking new video shows her legs collapsing out from under her while she is held up by strong-armed security men, then stumbling off the curb and collapsing face first into a waiting van.  That video, shown at this Youtube link, reveals Clinton to be the walking dead, as if she's going to literally collapse and expire at any moment.  The same shocking event was captured in another video from a different angle. Click here to view the second video (17 seconds). As you can see from this video, her Secret Service agents are primarily working to block any video recording of Hillary's disastrous (deplorable?) health status. They are now human shields against videography.  As is now obvious to any intelligent person, Hillary's health concerns are far, far worse than anything reported in the mainstream media. It now looks like Clinton is very, very sick and possibly near death.  The videos shown below are stunning in what they depict: A corrupt, criminal tyrant who deeply desires power over others now unable to control her own body... wobbling, collapsing, stumbling, with head head bobbling to the side as if her neck is on a loose swivel... then collapsing face forward into the waiting van.  See the full videos here:   Subcortical Vascular Dementia  According to a self-proclaimed medical school professor in another video shown below, Hillary Clinton has a disease called Subcortical Vascular Dementia which usually gives patients just a 3-5 year life expectancy. She also just passed out at a memorial event, according to sources (see below), and had to be rushed for medical assistance.  Click here to watch the first video, which includes this text description:  Hillary Clinton might actually have 1 year to live based on medical records that were leaked indicating she has a disease called Subcortical Vascular Dementia. While many videos have been made about her health, all of them have missed the severity of her illness. She could die very soon, since Vascular Dementia is progressive and has a 3-5 year life expectancy. Clinton actually has a severe form of the disease that impacts the subcortex region of the brain, which includes the brainstem. This might explain why Clinton is dry-coughing so much. The brainstem controls primitive functions of the body like breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure. When there is ischemia to this region, B/P, HR, and breathing won't function correctly. Hillary's cough is so noticeable because she can't seem to get over it. Most people only need a couple of coughs and they are able to overcome what is in their throat. But not Hillary. Hillary has tried to explain that she has an allergic cough. This is completely false and a lie. Based on her medical records, it is related to her Vascular Dementia, which she is dying of. She could rapidly decline if circulation is weak to the brainstem.   Hillary's health record also states that she has complex partial seizures. I have witnessed many people who have had seizures, and I believe Hillary is definitely showing signs of seizing activity. With complex partial seizures, one can show signs such as head nodding or lip smacking. Hillary, has had several instances where she appears to have had a seizure, the most well-known is when she was in front of a group of reporters. External, noxious stimuli can trigger seizing in certain individuals. Hillary had a seizure in front of the reporters. Not unsurprisingly, they are trying to control her seizures using a Diazepam autoinjector. Autoinjectors are used with urgent drugs such as Diazepam and Epinephrine in order to stop an life-threatening event from happening. If Hillary has seizures, they could cause an oxygen deficiency in the brain, resulting in damage and further progression of her VaD. An autoinjector is needed to control the seizure.   Doctor says Hillary Clinton appears to have Parkinson's  In this video interview on Next News Network, Dr. Ted Noel explains to Gary Franchi that Hillary Clinton has a disease which disqualifies her from holding public office.  From the description:  Through Dr. Noel's astute observations, and relying on over 30 years in the medical field, he has concluded that Hillary Clinton is exhibiting the classic signs that point to Parkinson's Disease. He has decided to go public with his findings and appears on the Next News Network to deliver you the truth, being kept from the public, about a diagnosis that will keep her out of the Oval Office.   Secret Service agent confirms Hillary Clinton's serious disease status  In this third video, Dr. Ted Noel details even more revelations about Hillary Clinton losing consciousness during public speaking events and even a U.S. Secret Service agent confirming the seriousness of her disease.  What's astonishing is how serious neurological coughing fits, public fainting and obvious public seizures are being dismissed by the complicit mainstream media as allergies or even conspiracy theories.  This video by Dr. Ted Noel is the best summary yet of Hillary Clinton's serious neurological disease status.   Hillary's motorcade includes a private ambulance, gurney and EMT rescue workers wearing bulletproof vests  Finally, this video from Infowars reveals video proof of bulletproof vest-wearing EMT workers with a gurney and an ambulance as part of Hillary Clinton's motorcade.  From the video description:  Infowars reporter, Millie Weaver broke the story that Hillary Clinton has a personal medical crew that rolls a gurney up to the backstage area where she holds cough-filled rallies. The video shown is from her infamous Coughing Cleveland rally held over Memorial Day weekend.  This video shows Hillary Clinton's motorcade arriving and leaving with an ambulance. Donald Trump's motorcade arrives without an ambulance. This obviously debunks the straw man argument that all presidential candidates have an ambulance in their motorcade.   Hillary Clinton passes out at memorial event, has to be rushed to medical assistance  On top of all this, Hillary Clinton had a 'medical episode' that required her to leave a 9/11 commemoration ceremony early on Sunday, reports Fox News:  The Democratic presidential nominee appeared to faint on her way into her van and had to be helped by her security, the source said. She was clearly having some type of medical episode. ... But a witness told Fox News that Clinton stumbled off the curb, her knees buckled and she lost a shoe as she was helped into a van during her unexpected early departure. ... An unverified video of the episode appeared to show Clinton collapsing as she was helped into the van.  That video is the one shown at the top of this article.  Bottom line: Hillary Clinton might croak before election day... or shortly thereafter  It's not just that Hillary Clinton is a lying traitor and political criminal who has sold out America to the highest bidder -- see The Clinton Files white paper on NewsTarget.com -- it's also that Hillary Clinton is obviously and irrefutably unfit for duty.  If any Republican showed all these symptoms, the entire leftist media would be demanding they step aside for health reasons. Yet Hillary's very obvious seizures and neurological fits are beyond alarming... they are clear signs that Hillary Clinton is neurologically unfit to serve as President of the United States."	Fake
" Clinton Foundation caught giving watered down AIDS drugs to third world countries http://www.naturalnews.com/055445_Clinton_Foundation_AIDS_drugs_corruption.html  (NaturalNews) Corruption and pay-for-play scenarios involving powerful people and foreign governments that beat, imprison and kill gays is like an onion: Peel a layer and you find more.  Now, as reported by The Daily Caller, it appears as though the charity was less than charitable with the AIDS drugs it helped distribute to third-world countries battling the disease.  Under a program begun by former President Bill Clinton, the Clinton Health Access Initiative, officials distributed watered-down HIV/AIDS drugs to sick patients in sub-Saharan Africa, which likely increased their risk of dying, according to a draft congressional report The Daily Caller News Foundation obtained.  Titled, The Clinton Foundation and the India Success Story, the congressional report was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., who is vice chairperson of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The CHAI program to assist AIDS victims has been considered to be a fundamental force for good within the Clinton Foundation and is very probably the organization's most notable initiative.  The congressional reported centered on Clinton's 10-plus-year relationship with a controversial India-based drug maker called Ranbaxy. CHAI used the company as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS medications to poor countries.  Undermining the integrity of approval process  The report also focused on the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a big-time whistleblower when he provided information to the U.S. government, which led to a landmark lawsuit against the Indian pharmaceutical company. Because the company also sold generic drugs in the United States, it was subject to U.S. regulations and prosecution for violations.  Ultimately, in 2013 the company pleaded guilty to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and to introducing adulterated medications into interstate commerce. Adulterated is when a drug fails to conform to compendial standards of quality, strength or purity, according to the Food and Drug Administration.  In addition, the Department of Justice levied a fine against the company of $500 million, as well as forfeiture.  As noted by The Daily Caller, U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland, Rod J. Rosenstein, said at the time of Ranbaxy's guilty plea the case represented the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in his district, as well as the nation's largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company.  When companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of the FDA's approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe, added Stuart F. Delery, the acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Justice Department, after the U.S. government made its announcement regarding Ranbaxy's case.  In its final settlement, the Department of Justice stated that, allegedly due to the company's diluted drugs, it 'subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,' the congressional report noted.  In an interview with The Daily Caller, Blackburn said the drugmaker's and foundation's actions produce some obvious questions, like, How many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise?  More problems for Hillary Clinton's campaign  Revelations about CHAI potentially distributing adulterated AIDS drugs to Third World victims is likely to damage the Clinton Foundation's reputation even further, and may add another layer of corruption to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. Sadly, unless her GOP opponent, Donald J. Trump, brings it up, the mainstream media won't be talking about it any time soon.  As for Blackburn, she said she is planning to hand the report over to the inspector general's offices of the Department of Health and Human Services and the State Department, where Hillary Clinton served during President Obama's first term.  In addition to findings of adulterated drug distribution, the report also shined a light on unseemly ties between Bill Clinton and a pair of highly controversial Indian-Americans who have fallen under investigation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Perhaps what is most problematic for the Clinton charity is its enthusiastic promotion of Ranbaxy, even though the Indian pharmaceutical giant persistently distributes poor-quality drugs, and covers for their faulty products with fraudulent reporting to the FDA.

" DNC bombshell: Murdered staffer Seth Rich sent THOUSANDS of emails to WikiLeaks, undermining entire bogus story that Russia hacked election http://www.naturalnews.com/2017-05-16-dnc-bombshell-murdered-staffer-seth-rich-sent-thousands-of-emails-to-wikileaks-undermining-entire-bogus-story-that-russia-hacked-election.html  (Natural News) An absolute bombshell report was published Tuesday that refutes completely the discredited mainstream media and Democratic Party lie that Russia was behind the hack of the Democratic National Committees email in the months leading up to the November election.  Fox News Malia Zimmerman writes that murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich was in contact with whistleblower website WikiLeaks and turned over thousands of emails to the site pertaining to the corrupt inner workings of the organization:  The Democratic National Committee staffer who was gunned down on July 10 on a Washington, D.C., street just steps from his home had leaked thousands of internal emails to WikiLeaks, investigative sources told Fox News.  A federal investigator who reviewed an FBI forensic report  generated within 96 hours after DNC staffer Seth Richs murder  detailing the contents Richs computer said he made contact with WikiLeaks through Gavin MacFadyen, a now-deceased American investigative reporter, documentary filmmaker, and director of WikiLeaks who was living in London at the time.  The federal investigator told the news site: I have seen and read the emails between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks, confirming that MacFadyen was genuine.  These claims are in line with details unearthed by Rod Wheeler, a former Washington Metropolitan Police homicide detective and contributor to Fox News. His private detective firm was hired by the Rich family to get to the bottom of his murder.  You may recall that Rich was shot very early in the morning walking home from a bar in D.C. He was very close to his home when he was gunned down. More intriguing is though D.C. police have labeled the murder a botched robbery, not a thing was stolen from Rich, though the shooter appeared to have plenty of time.  Also, as Fox News noted, D.C. Metro PD isnt being cooperative; they wont talk to the press and they wont release video footage of the murder, which is standard procedure when cops are actually trying to find out whodunit.  The federal investigator said that Rich sent MacFadyen 44,053 emails which contained 17,761 attachments from January 2015 through May 2016.  Fox News noted further:  On July 22, just 12 days after Rich was killed, WikiLeaks published internal DNC emails that appeared to show top party officials conspired to stop Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont from becoming the partys presidential nominee. That controversy resulted in Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigning as DNC chairperson. A number of Sanders supporters refused to back party nominee Hillary Clinton, and some subsequently formed groups to work against Clinton and the party.  WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has repeatedly claimed that Russia was not the source of the documents. That claim was echoed by former Trump campaign chief Roger Stone just last week.  Whats more, as Natural News founder/editor Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, reported in December, citing an exclusive from the UKs Daily Mail, the DNC wasnt hacked at all, but that documents provided to WikiLeaks were done the old-fashioned way  they were leaked  by someone upset at the way the DNC was treating Sanders:  After days of witnessing the left-wing media hyperventilate over completely fabricated claims that the Russians hacked the DNC emails and turned them over to Wikileaks, it turns out the emails were actually leaked by a DNC insider who was angry about the orchestrated elimination of Bernie Sanders by Clinton operatives.  The UK Daily Mail is now reporting that Craig Murray, the former British ambassador to Uzbekistan, personally met the email leaker who handed him the emails files later released by Wikileaks. The email leaker, a Bernie Sanders insider, was reportedly motivated by disgust at the corruption of the Clinton Foundation and the tilting of the primary election playing field against Bernie Sanders, reports the Daily Mail.  The hand-off took place in Washington D.C. in a wooded area near American University, Murray explained.  As Julian Assange has made crystal clear, the leaks did not come from the Russians, writes Murray on his website. As I have explained countless times, they are not hacks, they are insider leaks  there is a major difference between the two. And it should be said again and again, that if Hillary Clinton had not connived with the DNC to fix the primary schedule to disadvantage Bernie, if she had not received advance notice of live debate questions to use against Bernie, if she had not accepted massive donations to the Clinton foundation and family members in return for foreign policy influence, if she had not failed to distance herself from some very weird and troubling people, then none of this would have happened. The continued ability of the mainstream media to claim the leaks lost Clinton the election because of Russia, while still never acknowledging the truths the leaks reveal, is Kafkaesque.  But still, the disgusting #NeverTrump Washington media has continued to echo the lie that the DNC was hacked, and this despite the fact that the organization refused to give the FBI permission to examine their email system in order to confirm it.  As we have said early and often, this entire Russia-Trump-collusion-hacking-steal the election narrative is a massive hoax committed against the American people by the Washington establishment and Deep State.  This latest report by Fox News  which, frankly, should be the No. 1 story of the day if not the entire election  proves that the Russians are being blamed for something Moscow did not do. (RELATED: Bombshell: Murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich leaked thousands of emails to WikiLeaks)  This isnt to say that the Kremlin has not attempted to interfere in U.S. elections; Russias been trying to do that since the days of the Cold War (and vice versa for the United States).

" Harvey Flooding Uncovers Secret Stash Of Ammo Hidden By Obama Administration http://ourlandofthefree.com/2017/09/harvey-flooding-uncovers-secret-stash-of-ammo-hidden-by-obama-administration/ A cache of weapons long suspected to be hidden in Texas during Operation Jade Helm 15 was uncovered by the flood waters of Hurricane Harvey. The stockpile, hidden in a small town outside of Lexmar, matches numbers in the inventory reported missing during Obamas tenure.  Obama and his administration flat out refused to answer where more than 200 million rounds of ammunition went while he was commander-in-chief. The traitor always maintained that there had to be a clerical error. Now that nearly 10 percent of that ammo has been found, little question remains what happened to it.  The questions that do remain will have to be answered. There are 180 million rounds of ammunition out there that could be slated for use by an invasion force led by Barack Hussein Obama. He has almost a billion dollars worth of weapons and equipment. Having stockpiles of automatic rifle ammo, hand grenades and mortar shells dispersed around the country would come in awfully handy in an all-out ground assault.  Attorney General Jeff Sessions said that the stockpile is being carefully inventoried to try to establish a chain of custody. Many of the lot numbers that appear on the cases have simply vanished from the GAOs accounting. When all is said and done, there will be few people between the manufacturer and the last officer to order a lot moved. Someone will be forced to pony up some answers.  Hopefully, this will put an end to Obamas Deep State Shadow Government. If it can be established that he stole from the taxpayers for a planned coup after he left office, he can be charged with high treason."	Fake

The teenage Obama faces a good bit of time in prison and has even been suspended from Harvard until the conclusion of the trial, but the regular course of justice is not acceptable to the Obama family.  According to sources within Harvard, Barack Obama called school president Harmon Finklestein and angrily demanded that his daughter be allowed to attend the university. Of course, he caved.  It has been brought to our attention that the young Miss Obama has not been found guilty of a crime and therefore we acted hastily in suspending her, Finklestein said in a statement late Sunday night. We sincerely apologize to the Obama family and specifically to Malia for any harm we caused.  The lifting of Obamas suspension means she can move into the dorms with other students, perhaps with drugs she obtained elsewhere.  There is no justice when the Obamas are involved."	Fake
" Kurdistan Referendum: Divide and Rule Policy against the Islamic Countries https://www.veteranstoday.com/2017/09/29/kurdistan-referendum-divide-and-rule-policy-against-the-islamic-countries/  Controversial referendum which was held on September 25, 2017 for an independent Kurdistan, with approximately 93 percent in favour of independence, heightened tensions in Iraq and among its neighbouring countries, including other Islamic countries.  In this regard, on June 7, 2017, Kurdish President Masoud Barzani had held a meeting with the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and other parties, where the independence referendum was confirmed to be conducted. Then, the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) based in Erbil which is the capital city of Kurdistan Region in Iraq, had decided to conduct a unilateral referendum on independence, including in areas outside of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region.  In reaction to the results of referendum, on September 27, 2017, Iraqs Parliament asked the countrys Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to deploy troops to the oil-rich city of Kirkukone of several areas held by Kurdish troops, but recaptured by Baghdad, and to take control of all other oil fields in the Kurdish region. Iraqs federal government decided to shut down international flights to and from the region.  Showing, Russian reaction on the referendum, Russia Today (RT) pointed out on September 27, this year, The Russian Foreign Ministry said after Iraqi Kurds voted for secessionThe vote has the potential to further destabilize the already unstable regionThe Russian party believes it to be of utmost importance to avoid anything that risk to further complicate and destabilize the Middle East, which is already overloaded by conflict situationsMoscow says it continues to support the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq and other Middle East nationsThe poll was protested in Baghdad as well as in Turkey and Iran, countries that have significant Kurdish minorities living close to Iraqi Kurdistan. Turkey in particular has waged a decades-long war with guerrilla forces of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which seeks to break away from AnkaraAs the vote was underway in Iraqi Kurdistan, Iraq and Turkey staged a massive joint military exercise in an apparent demonstration of force to the Kurds.  Iran and the UN have also spoken out against the poll, saying, It will only distract from the ongoing fight against Daesh and further destabilize the region.  As part of the double game, the US Administration led by the President Donald Trump attempted to persuade the KRG to delay the referendum, fearing further friction between Erbil and Baghdad could derail the fight against the Islamic State (Also known Daesh, ISIS, ISIL) and Iraqs fragile peace.   On September 22, 2017, after a Cabinet meeting chaired by the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdag have stated, Turkey calls for referendum to be cancelledA Kurdish independence referendum is illegitimate and poses a direct threat to Turkeys national security and Iraqs territorial integrity and national unity.  However, Turkey, Syria and Iran who have their own sizable Kurdish minorities, have all strongly condemned the independence referendum.  While, Israels Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has voiced his backing for Kurdish independence. Similarly, some Kurdish leaders have balked at overt support from Israel, as they face hostility from Arab, Turkish and Iranian leaders that an independent Kurdish state would be a potential second Israel that is, an enemyin their midst. Nevertheless, some Kurds have flaunted support from and ties with the Jewish state, waving Israeli flags at pro-independence rallies.  In this respect, The Washington Post reported on September 25, 2017, Blue and white Israeli flags have become a common sight in the Kurdish regional capital, Irbil. Some Kurds fly them on their carsat massive rallies ahead of referendum on independenceIsrael has been a vocal advocate of Kurdish independence in the lead-up to the vote, and in a region where Israeli flags are most often seen being trampled or burned, the images were strikingIsrael, though, had expressed wholehearted support-until recently at least. Historically Israel has had cordial ties with the Kurdsits politicians say they feel a natural kinship with the Kurds, seeing similarities in their struggle for a homelandThe Israeli relationship with the Kurds has deep roots. Kurdistans Jews trace their heritage to the members of the Israelite tribe of Benjamin, who arrived in the area in the 8th century B.C. Today, there are more than 200,000 Kurdish Jews in Israel. Israel also provided military support to the Kurds, including trainers, antiaircraft weaponry and a military hospital, according to the Mossad intelligence agencys station chief in Irbil in the 1970s. For Israel, support of Kurdistan is consistent with a long-standing foreign policy strategy. Since the time of Israels first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, the countryIsolated in a regionfollowing its independence in 1948, Israel attempted to form alliances with non-Arab and minority populations in the Middle EastWhile the Arab nation-states are eroding, we must find our allies, our sustainable allies, said Gideon Saar, a former Israeli interior minister who has urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to do more to lobby for the Kurdish cause in his meetings with President TrumpIsrael has also maintained economic ties with Kurdistan, purchasing Kurdish oil despite objections from Iraqs central government in Baghdad.  Referring to Israels support for independence referendum in Iraqi Kurdistan, Turkish President Erdogan said on September 26, 2017,Israel should review its support for Iraqi Kurdish independence, warning the Jewish states support for the bid could negatively affect diplomatic ties between Ankara and Jerusalem. Erdogan who has threatened military intervention over the vote, also warned the Kurds that Israels backing will not save you.  Although Jerusalem and Ankara struck a reconciliation deal in August 2016 after years of severed ties following the flotilla incident, Erdogan has continued to publicly chastise Israel in harsh terms over its policies towards the Palestinians and the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.  Top Iranian officials have also claimed that the Kurdish independence referendum is part of an Israeli scheme, with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khameneis chief of staff saying on September 26, this year that the vote was a Zionist plot meant to fuel violence in the Middle East, following the battlefield defeats in Iraq and Syria suffered by the Islamic State terror group.  On September 22, 2017, in the New York Times, David M. Halbfinger also pointed out about Israeli-Mossad connections with Kurds and wrote, Mr. Netanyahu, who endorsed not only the referendum, but also the establishment of a Kurdistan state, had ample strategic reason: A breakaway Kurdistan could prove valuable to Israel against IranOver the years, Israeli doctors set up a field hospital for the Kurds, its soldiers trained the pesh merga fighters and the Mossad helped arm themThe Kurds have long patterned their lobbying efforts in Washington on those of Israels supportersBut Mr. Netanyahu had little to lose from his endorsement of the referendum, experts sayIsrael is desperate for friends in the region, the Kurds generally want to be friends, and they dont care about Palestine, said Kenneth M. Pollack, a former C.I.A. analyst and National Security Council official who visits Kurdistan frequently. Moreover, Israel stands to gain a potentially valuable ally in its struggle with Iran, he said.Iraqi and Iranian Kurds have deep tiesAnd to create trouble for Iran, one way is to encourage independence for Iranian Kurdsand that an independent Kurdistan will be a base for Israeli operations against Iran, via Irans Kurdish population.  Notably, on February 10, 2016, President Erdogan had lashed out at the US over its support for Syrias main Kurdish group, saying, The failure to recognize the Democratic Union Party (PYD) as a terrorist group is creating a sea of blood. He explained, The PYD, on which the US relies to battle so-called Islamic State in Syria, is an offshoot of the banned Kurdistan Workers Party.  After the failed rebellion-attempt of July 15, 2016, Turkeys president Erdogan and high officials of his government had held the US and CIA for the failed coup to topple his regime by backing and replacing Erdogan with the CIAs designated figurehead, cleric Fethullah Glen, currently living in Pennsylvania in the US.  By neglecting American pressure, President Erdogan who has taken steps to improve relations with Russia to strengthen its hand in fighting against militants and joined Russian coalition against ISIS, had stated that the terror attack at the Istanbul airport should serve as a turning point in the global battle against terrorism. The close ally of NATO, Turkey also decided to make a military agreement with Moscow. In July 2017, Ankara agreed to pay $2.5 billion to acquire Russias most advanced missile defense system.  In fact, after the defeat of the CIA-Israeli-led rebel groups, Al-Qaedas Al-Nusra Front and ISIS militants by the Russian-led coalition of Iran, Iraq, the Syrian army-the National Defence Forces (NDF) and Lebanon-based Hezbollah in Syria and Iraqkilling of the commanders of these terrorist outfits who are on fleeand after failure of the CIA-prepared plan-B regarding the partition of Syria, both the US and Israel have decided to implement the scheme of an independent state of Kurdistan. The Kurdish people who number roughly 30 million across several countries were left stateless when the Ottoman Empire collapsed a century ago.   Nevertheless, the US-Israeli support to the independence of Kurdistan is part of the divide and rule policy against the Islamic countries.  Like the United States, Ottoman Empire of Turkey was a large multi-ethnic state. European powers, especially the Great Britain played a key role in disintegration of the Ottoman Empire. In order to maintain their control, one of the British strategies was divide and rule which was being practiced through various tactics such as arrangement of rebellions, manipulation of ethnic and sectarian differences and so on. The Britain provided soldiers, weapons and money to the Arab subjects against that Empire. According to the Sykes-Picot Agreement, the British and French agreed to divide the Arab world between themselves. The Britain took control of what are now Iraq, Kuwait, and Jordan. The French were given modern Syria, Lebanon and southern Turkey. Thus, they brought about the end of the Ottomans and the rise of the new states like Jordon, Sudan, Syria, Kuwait etc. with borders running across the Middle East, dividing Muslims from each other.  The British Mandate of Palestine was given by the League of Nations to the United Kingdom to administer the territory. During the World War I, the Zionists pressurized the British government to settle them in Palestine after the war. Within the British government, there were many who were sympathetic to this political movement. As regards the Balfour Declaration, it was a letter dated November 2, 1917 from British Foreign Secretary Arthur James Balfour to Lord Rothschild, a leader of the British Jewish community for onward transmission to the Zionist Federationthe leader of Zionism in the United States during that period, Louis Brandeis who was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1916 by Woodrow Wilson, was a man with deep conspiratorial connections.  On 14th May 1948, the UNO implemented the 1947 UN Partition Plan and established the state of Israel. With backing of the US and West, Israel continued usurping the Palestinian land.  It is notable that despite Pakistans membership of the US sponsored military alliances SEATO and CENTO including Pak-US bilateral military agreement, America did not come to help Pakistan against India which separated the East Pakistan in 1971.  Lieutenant-Colonel Ralph Peters. (R) who served as the Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence, within the US Defence Department, with numerous essays on strategy for military journals is the architect of infamous 2006New Middle East map and is an advocator for the disintegration of Muslim states on sectarian and religious lines. His map shows a number of Islamic countries including Pakistan as truncated. While writing in the June 2006 issue of The Armed Forces Journal of the US, he had suggested Washington about the creation of a Greater Balochistan which would integrate the Baloch areas of Pakistan with those of Iranand the Frontier Province (Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa) should be incorporated into Afghanistanfragmentation of Iraq, Syria and Yemen.  While, Pakistans Armed Forces have successfully broken the backbone of the foreign-backed terrorists by the military operations Zarb-e-Azb and Radd-ul-Fasaad which have also been extended to other parts of the country, including Balochistan province and Karachi. Army and countrys primary intelligence agency ISI have broken the network of these terrorist groups by capturing several militants, while thwarting a number of terror attempts. These operations are obtaining their objectives effectively and rapidly. Peace has been restored in various regions of Pakistan, including Karachi and Balochistan. But, recent blasts in Balochistan and other regions of the country show that the US-led India, Afghanistan and Israel have again started acts of sabotage to destabilize Pakistan and to damage the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).  Besides terrorism-related assaults in the US and Europe, Muslim countries are special target of the ISIS and its linked militant groups. In the recent past, new wave of terrorism in Pakistan, killed several innocent people, while various terrorist outfits, particularly the ISIL and the affiliated faction of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan Jamaat-ur-Ahrar (TTP-JA also known as JuA) claimed responsibility for these brutal acts. TTP based in Afghanistan has its connections with ISIL and other terrorist organizations and affiliated terror groups, including Baloch separatist elements, and all these outfits are promoting the anti-Pakistan agenda of the foreign entities against Pakistan. As part of the double game, CIA, RAW, Mossad and Afghan intelligence agency, National Directorate of Security (NDS) which are in collaboration, are using these terror outfits in weakening Pakistan and especially Balochistan in order to fulfill the covert strategic aims of the US-led India and Israel against Pakistan, China, Russia and Iran.  These external secret agencies are especially supporting the TTP which is hiding in Nuristan and Kunar provinces of Afghanistan. Reportedly, Mullah Fazlullah led TTP is behind several terror activities inside Pakistan, as the latter has also become center of the Great Game due to the ideal location of Balochistan. Besides, Washington, New Delhi and Tel Aviv have been weakening Pakistan, because it is the only nuclear country in the Islamic world. They want to shift Afghan war to Pakistan.  Nonetheless, the term New Middle East which was first coined by the then US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in June 2006 in Tel Aviv coincided with the inauguration of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) Oil Terminal in the Eastern Mediterranean. The Israeli ex-Prime Minister Olmert favored the New Middle East project in wake of the Anglo-American backed Israeli siege of Lebanon.  Orchestrated drama of the 9/11 and fake global war on terror, planned by the Zionists, Israeli lobbies and the neoconservativesoccupation of Afghanistan by the US-led NATO, Anglo-American invasion of Iraq, like the creation of Al-Qaeda by the CIA, ISIS as part of the anti-Muslim campaign, US President Barrack Obamas silence over the supply (Smuggling) of oil by ISIS and Iraqi Kurds to the European countries, toppling the elected government in Egypt, creation of more collapsed states such as Libya, Syria, Yemen etc., CIA support to the rebels, mercenaries and ISIS terrorists to topple the Syrian President Bashar al-Assads regime and other related-developments are part of further balkanization of the Middle East in accordance with the divide and rule policy to promote the interests of the Zionists and for a greater Israel.  Henry Kissinger who was staunch supporter of the US invasion of Iraq, had suggested the split of Iraq into three independent regions, ruled by Kurds, Shias and Sunnis. In this regard, the Asia Times Online reported in 2005, The plan of balkanizing Iraq into several smaller states is an exact replica of an extreme right-wing Israeli planan essential part of the balkanization of the whole Middle East. Curiously, Henry Kissinger was selling the same idea even before the 2003 invasion of Iraqthis is classic divide and rule: the objective is the perpetuation of Arab disunity.  It is of particular attention that the US had planned to spark a civil war between the Sunnis and Shias. For the purpose, a study of Rand Corporation, titled US Strategy in the Muslim World After 9/11 was conducted on behalf of the then US Deputy Chief of Staff for Air Force. Its report which was released on December 27, 2004 advocated that Sunni-Shia sectarian division should be exploited to promote the US objectives in the Muslim World. The report was first implemented in Iraq. CIA also got the services of Mossad to fuel sectarian violence in Iraq. In 2004, major terror-attacks were carried out against the Shias. Afterwards, a chain of Shia-Sunni clashes started between Iraqi Shias and Sunnis, targeting each others mosques, religious leaders through bomb blasts, suicide attacks etc. After Iraqs experiment, more deadly pattern of sectarian strife and clashes have been conducted in Pakistan. However, pursing the agenda of his predecessors, George W. Bush and Barrack Obama in its worst form, American President Trump is manipulating sectarian differences between Saudi Arabia and Iranalso noted in case of Syria and Yemen.  It is mentionable that the pro-American rulers of Arab countries, including some other Islamic countries are trying to protect their kingdoms, Sheikhdoms and governments by giving priorities to the Israeli global dominance at the cost of their own peoples. In the aftermath of the false flag terror attacks in Europe, which were, in fact, arranged by Mossad in connivance with some CIA operatives and ISIS terrorists in wake of the present anti-Muslim phenomena in the West, more resentment is found against the US-led West, and even the moderate Muslims are likely to join the militants. This could result into revolts against these Muslim rulers or civil warsanother danger of the divide and rule policy.  If the agenda of an independent Kurdistan is completed, it will create chaos in the Middle East, enveloping the entire world. Divide and rule policy will culminate into Clash of Civilizations, as predicated by Huntington. Any major war or such a clash will take the US and Europe to the erafrom 1511 to 1648 when Europe witnessed a prolonged arena of barbarism, religious bigotry and intolerance, resulting into beastly violence, and the Treaty of Westphalia was concluded in 1648 in order to maintain the nation-state system whose basic purpose was to honor the dignity of human beings.

" Former Pentagon Analyst Explains Why Trump Fostering Hysteria Over North Korea https://www.veteranstoday.com/2017/09/27/former-pentagon-analyst-explains-why-trump-fostering-hysteria-over-north-korea/ WASHINGTON (Sputnik)  President Donald Trump and members of his administration have been deliberately fostering public hysteria over North Korea to drown out voices opposed to any US military buildup, former Defense Department and Air Force analyst Lieutenant Colonel Karen Kwiatkowski told Sputnik.  During a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York earlier in the day, Trump said the United States would totally destroy North Korea if it was forced to. On Sunday, US Envoy to the UN Nikki Haley warned that the United States had plenty of unilateral military options to choose from to address Pyongyangs missile tests.  The public hysteria being promoted by the [Trump] administration indicates to me that this is an attempt to entertain the US population through fear, and shut down or limit public dissent, Kwiatkowski said on Tuesday. The Defense Department and its major contractors have been alarmed at the American publics growing opposition to massive spending and endless US military adventures and interventions around the world, Kwiatkowski pointed out.  That we are speaking today of North Korea and its destruction by the US military reveals the driving and desperate concern of the Pentagon and its economic dependencies, she said.  The United States has repeatedly tried to use the United States as a cover and justification for waging major wars around the world over the past nearly 70 years, Kwiatkowski recalled.  When the US goes to war as it did in Korea in 1950, Yugoslavia in 1991, Iraq in 1990 and again in 2003, it was under the auspice or strong appearance of UN support, she said.  Current US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has tried to build up support for a similar war against North Korea this year, but so far she had largely failed, Kwiatkowski observed.  Haleys efforts at the UN have been designed to garner such support this summer, and it appears she has been less than fully successful, in part because taking a US fight to North Korea is very similar to declaring war against China and Russia, she said.  The ploy had failed in part because Moscow and Beijing had both grown in global stature and influence in recent years, Kwiatkowski explained.  The governments of both China and Russia not only hold UN Security Council veto power, both have asserted themselves globally, financially and militarily in the past decade, she said. Also, US propaganda had not been successful so far in making the case for renewed war against North Korea to the American people, Kwiatkowski added.The domestic propaganda battle by the US Government and domestic war advocates has been largely ineffective, and does not seem to be catching fire yet, she said.  Efforts to play up the alleged North Korean threat to the Pacific island of Guam, a US dependency had also failed, Kwiatkowski noted.  Even the potential of a North Korean missile attack of US territory Guam, a tourist location serving a largely Asian clientele, was viewed by many residents of Guam as not much more than a schoolboy spat between two flamboyant and prone-to-exaggeration politicians, she said.  The Korean security crisis could be finally resolved if the United Statres finally agreed sign a lasting, full peace treaty with Pyongyang as it had failed to do since 1953, Kwiatkowski stated.  What needs to be done is to actually end the Korean War by committing to the peace treaty between the North and South that the 1953 Armistice was supposed to foster. The US government seems institutionally unable to support such a peace treaty, she said.  Washington did not want to sign such a peace treaty because it would then no longer have the excuse to continue to operate its massive military bases in South Korea, Kwiatkowski commented.  Of course, if a peace treaty were signed between North and South Korea, the US military bases in South Korea would no longer be required. Any treaty would likely require these US bases (Army, Navy, Air Force and intelligence operations) to be closed or shifted to South Korean military control, she said.  All war-games scenarios on a new Korean War result in greater global war with massive casualties and environmental destruction, Kwiatkowski warned.  Any hot war with North Korea results in literally a billion people dead [yet there are no fundamental US interests in North Korea than cannot be peacefully acquired or accomplished with the help of China and Russia, she said.  The Trump administration was seeking to intensify the crisis or defuse it, Kwiatkowski remarked.  Clearly, the US government is seeking to intensify the crisis, not diffuse it, she said.  US military needed the justification of continued and worsening crises because the Pentagon faces very real and very severe budget and influence reduction in coming years, as US debt grows rapidly and the US economy slows, Kwiatkowski concluded. Last week, North Korea tested an intermediate ballistic missile, which flew over Japan before falling into the Pacific Ocean about 20 minutes after the launch.The situation on the Korean Peninsula has escalated in recent months due to Pyongyangs ballistic missile launches and nuclear tests in violation of the UN Security Council resolutions. The UN Security Council has imposed sanctions on North Korea, which, however, have failed to prevent Pyongyang from conducting new tests."	Fake
" Erdogan  Turkey will close border with Iraqi Kurdish region https://www.veteranstoday.com/2017/09/25/erdogan-turkey-will-close-border-with-iraqi-kurdish-region/ [ Editors Note: The doo doo has hit the fan for Barzani. What I have been posing in my interviews over the last few days is that, with only Israel supporting the Iraqi Kurdish separatist move, there will be no international group to oppose the sanctions that will be raining down on Kurdistan.  And the biggest blow will be Erdogan cutting off access to Kurdish oil being exported through the Kirkuk-Ceyon pipeline. That will kill a major part of Barzanis income. Sure, he has stashed away tons of pilfered smuggled oil profits, but that might not last long.  Kurdish government workers are months behind getting paid, and I see that getting worse quickly. The glee we see in the streets today seems oblivious to what might be waiting down the road.  And what will happen when Baghdad cuts off the revenue-sharing agreed upon back in 2014  25% of the countrys oil revenue in return for 550,000 barrels a day? What if Prime Minister Abadi tells Barzani he can eat his oil because he is deemed to be leading an insurrection? Kurdistans airspace may also be shut down so goods cannot even be flown in.  Sure, I am aware of the Kurds past suffering, but that was another time. This looks like they are wanting to suffer. Was anyone thinking about these consequences when they dreamed up thisevent. I hardly know what to call it  it seems so crazy. If I am missing something here, please fill me in in the comments Jim W. Dean ] Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says Ankara will seal its border with the Iraqi Kurdistan Region over a contentious independence referendum the semi-autonomous region held on Monday, threatening the Kurdish leaders with blocking their key oil exports.  Speaking at a forum in Istanbul on Monday, the Turkish leader said the entrance-exit will be closed at the Habur border crossing, Turkeys sole land border crossing with the Arab country and the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG)s main gateway to the world.  After this lets see through which channels they will send their oil and who they will sell to. The valve is with us. Its finished the moment we close it, Erdogan further said, referring to the Kirkuk-Ceyhan oil pipeline that links oil fields in northern Iraq to the oil terminal in the Mediterranean.  The KRG, led by Massoud Barzani, held a non-binding vote on the secession of the Kurdish region from Iraq on Monday in a highly provocative move, which has infuriated the central government in Baghdad.  The vote, which was announced by the KRG earlier in the year, is being held in the region much to the consternation of the international community, particularly the regional countries, that warned it could most likely throw the already violence-weary country into more trouble.  Turkey, among others, has strongly opposed the referendum from the beginning and has already warned that the disintegration of Iraq has the potential to turn into a major conflict.  Military option in Kurdistan?  Elsewhere in his remarks on Monday, Erdogan did not rule out the military intervention in Iraqs Kurdish region to counter the creation of a Kurdish state on its southeastern border, hinting that the would-be state could be a safe haven for Kurdish militants, who fight against Ankara.  Just as weve liberated Jarablus, al-Rai, and al-Bab from Daesh [Takfiri terrorist group] in Syria, if need be, we wont shy away from such steps in Iraq. We may come there overnight all of a sudden, the Turkish president warned the KRG, referring to Turkeys military intervention in Syria, carried out last year, against Daesh terrorists and Syrian US-backed Kurdish militia, known as the YPG (Peoples Protection Units).  In August 2016, Turkey began a unilateral military intervention in northern Syria, code-named Operation Euphrates Shield, sending tanks and warplanes across the border, which Damascus denounced as a breach of its sovereignty.  Last week, the Turkish military commenced a drill in the region around the border town of Silopi, which is close to Syria and Iraq, involving 100 military vehicles, which continued with reinforcements this weekend and it is planned to continue until Tuesday.  We are taking and will take all the steps on political, economic, trade and security fronts. The armed forces did not take necessary steps in Silopi for no reason. There is no compromise, Erdogan promised.  Turkey regularly bombs the mountainous border area between Iraq and Turkey where PKK militants are based. Ankara has also deployed troops into the Iraqi soil, triggering a diplomatic crisis with Baghdad, which brought them to the brink of war at one point.  However, Turkey, which has a large Kurdish population, has robust economic ties to Iraqs Kurdish Regional Government. The standoff has weakened the Turkish lira beyond 3.5 to the dollar for the first time in four weeks.  Turkey considering closure of airspace to KRG  Meanwhile, Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said Ankara was evaluating measures regarding its border gates and airspace in response to the Iraqi Kurdish plebiscite on independence in northern Iraq.  I formed a study group with officials from concerned ministries They are working on the details and without losing time, we will take our steps regarding the management of our airspace and border gates, said the Turkish premier in an interview aired by multiple Turkish broadcasters on Monday.  He noted that the Turkish government would make decisions during more direct talks with Baghdad after the referendum, adding that economic, political, diplomatic and military steps were being discussed.  We will not enter an adventure unexpectedly in any way, but if there is an attitude that will harm the interests of our country, we will respond without delay, Yildirim said, thought promising Turkish citizens that we are not going to war.  Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu also warned on Monday that Ankara would intervene militarily if the Turkish population in Iraq was targeted.  Turkey takes Kurdish Rudaw channel off air  Meanwhile, reports say that Ankara has taken Kurdish television channel Rudaw off its satellite service, TurkSat. The channel is said to be linked to the KRG and has purported affiliation with Barzani.  We have only heard about the decision through the media. TurkSat has not notified us yet. So we are still on air, but the broadcast may be halted when we are notified, the Reuters quoted an unnamed Rudaw television official as saying.  Iran has also announced that it is opposed to the unilateral scheme for the independence of the Iraqi Kurdistan, underlining the importance of maintaining the integrity and stability of Iraq and insisting that the Kurdistan region is part of the majority Arab country.  On Sunday, Iran also closed its airspace to all flights to and from the Kurdish region at the request of the Iraqi government. In a statement on September 18, United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres had urged Iraqs Kurdish leaders to scrap the vote, saying it would undermine the ongoing battle in the Arab country against Daesh."

" E. Michael Jones: Trump is in cahoots with New York Jewish gangsters https://www.veteranstoday.com/2017/09/18/michael-jones-trump-is-in-cahoots-with-new-york-jewish-gangsters/ Jerusalem Post: Throughout much of his adult life and childhood, at seemingly every significant juncture in his business career, Donald J. Trump has surrounded himself with members of a single minority group. E. Michael Jones, a prolific writer and editor of Culture Wars magazine, has recently done an interview with Press-TV during which he said:  First question. Why is Donald Trump against the Iran nuclear agreement? The answer to that is he is from New York. The Jews control New York City. You cant go anywhere in the real estate business in New York City unless you go along with what they want. And this is basically the basis of his foreign policy.  He has no philosophical basis to do anything to analyze the policy to come up with some type of an alternative to the neocon catastrophe that has created the foreign policy ever since the invasion of Iraq in 2003.  This shouldnt surprise any observer at all. Even the Jerusalem Post has stated very clearly: Throughout much of his adult life and childhood, at seemingly every significant juncture in his business career, Donald J. Trump has surrounded himself with members of a single minority group,[1] and you know what that single minority group is by now.  Trump has also surrounded himself with political gangsters who are in cahoots with the Israeli regimes relentless liquidation of the Palestinians. For example, Trump nominated David Friedman as U.S. ambassador to Israel. According to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, Friedman is a bankruptcy lawyer who supports West Bank settlement construction and has expressed doubts about the two-state solution.[2]  The West Bank settlement construction is another word for Israels continued colonization, which is illegal under international law. But Israel has never once stopped this wicked activity. Even Israeli scholar and professor Zeev Maoz does not hesitate to write:  In 1993 there were about 110,000 settlers in the occupied territories. In 2001 there were 195,000 (Note that the number of settlers increased by 18 percent during the Al Aqsa Intifada). This was an increase of 73 percent.[3]  Baylis Thomas, a professor at Yeshiva University/Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Hospital, writes: Settlement building and roads for Jewish settlers proceeded at a frenetic pace under [Ehud] Barak  the classic Zionist maneuver of creating of facts on the ground to preclude a Palestinian state.[4]  The international community has universally condemned the settlements as well. Oxford scholar and expert Robert Adams writes:  The international community has taken a critical view of both deportations and settlements as being contrary to international law. General Assembly resolutions have condemned the deportations since 1969, and have done so by overwhelming majorities in recent years.  Likewise, they have consistently deplored the establishment of settlements, and have done so by overwhelming majorities throughout the period (since the end of 1976) of the rapid expansion in their numbers. The Security Council has also been critical of deportations and settlements; and other bodies have viewed them as an obstacle to peace, and illegal under international law.[5]  Israeli legal scholar and former Supreme Court of Israel Daphne Barak-Erez writes:  The international community, for its part, has viewed [the settlements] as patently illegal, based on the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention that prohibit moving populations to or from territories under occupation.[6]  Catriona Drew, professor of international law in the School of Law and the Centre for International Studies and Diplomacy at SOAS, University of London, says:  It can thus clearly be concluded that the transfer of Israeli settlers into the occupied territories violates not only the laws of belligerent occupation but the Palestinian right of self-determination under international law.[7]  In short, scholars actually agree that the Israeli settlements are illegal under international law,[8] despite the fact that some flaming Zionist and Israeli scholars have hopelessly and incoherently tried to justify them.[9]  And the settlements have grown astronomically over the years. In 2011 alone, The number of Jewish settlers in the West Bank grew by more than 15,000to reach a total that exceeds 350,000 for the first time and has almost doubled in the past 12 years.[10]  Can you imagine any country doing this in the twenty-first century without serious consequences from the West? Didnt the Zionist Mafia perversely argue that Vladimir Putin is really bad because Russia invaded Crimea? What we are seeing again and again is that the Zionist position is morally and existentially unlivable and politically dangerous.  -  As we saw in a previous article, Jared Kushner himself had personal and financial ties to Israeli settlements. As the Israeli newspaper Haaretz puts it: the family of Jared Kushner donated tens of thousands of dollars in recent years to projects in the settlements, including a small amount to one particularly radical yeshiva.  It was reported that Kushner had a long history of close personal and financial ties to the settlement movement and some of the most extreme settlementsThe report found that among organizations and institutions in the West Bank that receive funding from the Kushner family, the leading beneficiary is American Friends of Beit El Yeshiva. The president of American Friends of Beit El Yeshiva is David Friedman, Trumps senior adviser on Israel affairs. Located in one of the more hardline, ideological settlements, Beit El Yeshiva received $20,000 from the Kushner family in 2013.[11]  The Washington Post itself reported that Kushner donated almost $60,000 to the settlements,[12] but not a single US politician has ever dared to challenge that."

" In Latest Tweetstorm, Trump Again Threatens to Kill NAFTA and Demands Mexico Pay for Wall https://www.veteranstoday.com/2017/08/28/in-latest-tweetstorm-trump-again-threatens-to-kill-nafta-and-demands-mexico-pay-for-wall/ Trump has bragged that he is considered the Ernest Hemingway of 140 characters, but that didnt prevent Mexico from shooting his suggestion down.  In the latest case of the White House announcing major policy decisions via Twitter, President Donald Trump has fired off another social media salvo at the North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, while pledging once again to force the Mexican government to fund construction of a U.S.-Mexico border wall.  The Sunday morning tweets came days ahead of the second round of talks between the U.S., Canada and Mexico on a possible revamp of the free trade deal. Touted as a renegotiation by the White House and billed as a modernization by its NAFTA counterparts, the ambitious talks have already shown signs of deep divisions that will require major compromises by parties to the agreement.  In Trumps tweet, the former reality television star speculated about the possibility of terminating the talks due to the difficult renegotiation with the Canadian and Mexican trade teams. Trump regularly refers to NAFTA as the the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere.  Mexicos Ministry of Foreign Affairs took the tweet in its stride, noting that it will continue to be serious and constructive, always putting national interest ahead and seeking a deal that is mutually agreeable to the three North American countries.  Mexico will not negotiate NAFTA, nor any other aspect of the bilateral relationship through social networks or the media, the statement added.  Trump also repeated his campaign pledge vowing that the U.S. would proceed in building THE WALL while Mexico will pay for it through reimbursement/other. Trump has threatened to shut down the government if congressional Republicans fail to include funding for the barrier in a spending bill due by the end of September.  In a Jan. 27 phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pea Nieto, Trump beseeched him to stop publicly saying that Mexico wouldnt pay for the wall, according to a recently-released transcript of the call.  Believe it or not, this is the least important thing that we are talking about, but politically this might be the most important talk about, the U.S. head of state told Pea Nieto.  But the fact is we are both in a little bit of a political bind because I have to have Mexico pay for the wall  I have to, he added. We cannot say that anymore because if you are going to say that Mexico is not going to pay for the wall, then I do not want to meet with you guys anymore because I cannot live with that. I am willing to say that we will work it out, but that means it will come out in the wash and that is okay.  Mexicos Foreign Ministry reiterated in its statement that as the Mexican government has always maintained, our country will not pay, under any circumstances, for a wall or physical barrier that is built on US territory along the border with Mexico. This determination is not part of a Mexican negotiating strategy, but a principle of national sovereignty and dignity.  While critics have blasted President Trumps early-morning habit of addressing important and trivial issues alike through the social network as unbecoming of the commander-in-chief, Trump has defended the practice as not Presidential  its MODERN DAY PRESIDENTIAL.  During his election campaign, Trump bragged that he is considered the Ernest Hemingway of 140 characters, adding that if one of his detractors says something bad about him, bing bing bing  I say something really bad about them."

" Thanks To President Trump Radical Islamists Will No Longer Be Operating Jihad Training Sites in America http://patriothangout.com/thanks-president-trump-radical-islamists-will-no-longer-operating-jihad-training-sites-america/ ELDER PATRIOT  President Trump has stepped up the pressure on radical Islamists operating inside the United States and its started paying off. More than two years ago Ryan Mauro, a national security analyst for the Clarion Project appeared with Bill OReilly to discuss the growing jihadist threat inside the United States. Mauro had focused his comments on five organizations that have links to Islamic extremists that have established military style training bases inside our country with the plan to unleash Jihad against America.  One such training camp is located 145 northwest of New York City in Islamberg a secluded community outside the town of Hancock, NY.  Islamberg is the home to Sufi cleric Sheikh Syed Mubarik Ali Shah Gilani and an unknown number of radical followers. Naturally, Mauro was discredited by the MSM for reporting on this. Two and a half years later we have learned that a raid on the compound conducted by NY State authorities uncovered a sizable cache of weapons in a storage locker belonging to Ramadan Abdullah that included: 8 assault weapons 4 loaded handguns 1 loaded shotgun 2 rifles 64 high-capacity ammunition feeding devices flak jackets 1,000s of rounds of ammunition, including .50-caliber armor-piercing rounds 64-year old Ramadan Abdullah, a long-time associate of a U.S.-based Islamist terrorist organization, Muslims of America (MOA), and a ranking member of the Islamberg cult was arrested and a search of his past revealed: He was previously arrested in 1977 when he tried to rob a store A man was murdered during the robbery A search of his home uncovered enough materials to build 50 bombs Before the raid on Abdullahs storage locker in July he was arrested trying to steal four boxes of ammunition from a local store. All of this led police to begin searches of other locations that Abdullah often visited.  These searches turned up loaded handguns, more high-capacity ammunition feeding devices and ammunition. While New York State Police Major Jim Barnes said, Theres no indication there was a plan in place to commit an act of violence, he did confirm that police believe Abdullah had made trips overseas. During that 2015 interview Mauro had shown OReilly a video given to him by a law enforcement source that shows members marching with rifles in apparent guerilla warfare training. Mauro also identified: The Dar-al Hijrah mosque in the Seven Corners section of Falls Church, Va., that was once led by Anwar al-Awlaki, the al Qaeda al-Awlaki. The mosque, near Washington, D.C., is now led by an imam who said, Muslims shall be first in line for the arms for jihad. The Masjid At Taqwa mosque in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn The Islamic Circle of North America, a radical group that is legitimized by only 2 percent of American Muslims that has its headquarters a few miles from Masjid At Taqwa in Queens, New York. CAIR, or the Council on American-Islamic Relations. The US Department of Justice has classified CAIR as a political influence organization of the Muslim brotherhood. Yet nothing was done to check this radical Islamic threat until earlier this month.  Somehow Im led to conclude that as long as Obama was president nothing would ever be done to protect us from Islamic extremism. Or, maybe it was just Jim Comeys worthless direction of the F.B.I. that let these groups operate with impunity. Thank God for Donald Trump. "	Fake
" Oregons DEMOCRAT GOVERNORs SOLUTION TO ANCHOR BABIES  KILL THEM ELDER PATRIOT  http://patriothangout.com/oregon-democrat-governors-solution-anchor-babies-kill/ Oregon Governor Kate Brown has promised to sign a bill allowing for state-funded early termination of the offspring of illegal aliens. At a time when healthcare costs have already skyrocketed out of the reach of most Americans, Oregon Democrats forced through, on a party line vote, a radical pro-abortion bill that would require health insurers to provide free abortions to patients without a co-pay. It also would set aside $10.2 million tax dollars for abortions for illegal aliens, as well as for contraception and other reproductive health services for 2017 through 2019 in the states Medicaid fund. Given the already easy access to low-cost abortions and the low cost of contraception that already exists in Washington Browns claims that opponents of the bill are, Attempt[ing] to deny access to contraceptives and family planning are an attack on all Oregonians, is ludicrous. But she really let her hand show with this declaration that wouldve made Joseph Goebbels proud:  Im proud the House helped fulfill our duty to ensure all Oregons children have access to health care by passing #CoverAllKids today. How in the world does killing babies ensure childrens access to healthcare unless its to make sure theres not enough of them to overtax the already bankrupt system??? Margaret Sanger founded Planned Parenthood with the goal of exterminating blacks.  Today, Kate Brown has declared her intent to exterminate illegal aliens. Surely President Trumps plan to simply build a wall to keep them out and to deposit the lawbreakers among those already here on the other side of that wall is preferable, dont you think? Arguments that illegal aliens are only one beneficiary of her plan doesnt pass muster.  Abortions are cheap enough  as is contraception  the argument that government has to pay for either is simply not believable. The bill necessarily had to include every Oregonian in order to pass the equal protection standard required to pass Constitutional muster. Kate Brown has forever linked her named to another eugenicist  Margaret Sanger.  The lack of outrage is sad as we watch another block in the foundation of respect of every human life that once made the United States great being further eviscerated."	Fake
" FRAUD: Democrat Worker Sentenced to Prison for Registering Dead Voters http://patriothangout.com/fraud-democrat-worker-sentenced-prison-registering-dead-voters/ HANNITY| A liberal student at James Madison University was sentenced to upwards of four months in prison for registering dead people to vote in the state of Virginia, reports the Richmond Times-Dispatch. Andrew Spieles, a 21-year old man from Harrisonburg, Virginia, was found guilty after admitting he filed phony registration applications at least 18 times, often involving dead people. The student worked for Harrisonburg Votes, an organization with close ties to the states democratic party. In August 2016, Spieles was directed to combine his registration numbers with those of another individual because their respective territories overlapped, said a statement from the U.S. Attorneys Office. Every Thursday an employee/volunteer hand-delivered the paper copies of the registration forms to the Registrars Office in Harrisonburg. The scheme was discovered after election officials noticed that new voter applications were turning up in the names of recently deceased people, including the father of a prominent local judge. The Registrars Office discovered multiple instances of similarly falsified forms when it reviewed additional registrations. Some were in the names of deceased individuals while others bore incorrect middle names, birth dates, and social security numbers, the statement added. Spieles told the court he submitted the fraudulent material in order to reach a pre-determined quota imposed on him by Harrisonburg Votes."	Fake
" DEMOCRAT GOVERNOR & CLINTON INSIDER BUSTED Trying To COVER UP MASSIVE VOTER FRAUD  TRUMP WAS RIGHT http://patriothangout.com/ider-bkkked-0/ Democrats love voters.  All voters. White ones, brown ones, boy ones, girl ones  even illegal ones.  And if youre illegal and brown, why, they might even throw a parade for you.  They claim that voter fraud is non-existent, but maybe thats because leftists do such a good job hiding it.  Like in Virginia, when state officials tried to hide decades of voter fraud in their state  where foreign nationals, illegal immigrants, and others were casting ballots in elections for decades. A new report released by the Public Interest Legal Foundation (PILF) showed there were more than 5,000 noncitizens who were registered to vote and were bumped from the voter rolls.  Heres the kicker: Those 5,000 were only pulled from the rolls because they self-reported that they shouldnt be voting, The Washington Times reports.  Starting with Gov. Terry McAuliffe, officials desperately tried to hide the fraud.  At the instruction of Governor McAuliffes political appointees, local election officials spent countless resources to prevent this information from spilling into the open, PILF President J. Christian Adams said in a statement releasing the report. From NoVa to Norfolk and all urban and rural points in between, alien voters are casting ballots with practically no legal consequences in response.  This is just one issue that is likely to come up as President Trumps voter integrity commission investigates the elections process and finding out how people who shouldnt vote do and people who want to vote cant.  President Donald Trump singled Virginia out as a locus of massive voter fraud after last years election. In late November, explaining his shortfall in the national popular vote, Mr. Trump said there was serious fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California.   He didnt give specific evidence, but attributed a lack of attention to the issue to serious bias in the press.  Big problem! Mr. Trump said on Twitter.  Edgardo Cortes, Virginias elections commissioner, said at the time said there were no indications of fraud, saying that the ballots cast were counted properly.  But Mr. Trumps contention is not that valid votes werent cast. He says, rather, that millions of ineligible voters are being allowed to vote."	Fake
" Federal Prosecutor Found Dead, Take A WILD GUESS WHAT HE WAS INVESTIGATING [VIDEO] A reputable Miami prosecutor, Beranton J Whisenant Jr., likely never thought his life was in danger.  Yet, the mans body just washed up on a Hollywood, Florida beach. Whisenant had been investigating DNC voter fraud. (via Dennis Michael Lynch). This husband and father of three was only 37. He leaves behind a devastated family and community.  Also, he wasnt just investigating the DNC voter fraud. He was also in charge of a few cases of other crimes, those which the liberals love to pretend dont exist: passport and visa fraud. This man was no friend to those in the deep state, who would rather their crimes go overlooked. Many Democrats, who rely on illegal voters and even voter fraud, would have ample reason to want Beranton Whisenant out of the way. The mainstream media is already doing their part to cover-up any potential wrong-doing in this case. The Miami Herald has suggested that if the death was a crime or retaliatory than authorities would be more aggressive.  For their part, police have simply stated that Whisenant seems to have suffered some kind of head trauma, possibly a gun shot. They are still looking into the matter.  There is no reason to think authorities are not being aggressive in their pursuit of this case. Why cant the media just let the police do their job? Why cant the media just stay out of the way in general and report the FACTS like theyre supposed to?  Any American death deserves a full investigation from authorities. There is no reason to dismiss the possibility that Whisenant was murdered. If he was murdered, the media is just enabling a serious criminal.  We patriots prefer to support authorities in their investigation. No one can deny that the body of a prosecutor washing up on a beach, with head trauma, is a serious matter that deserves our full attention. Whisenant matters to us, and he matters to his community.  Benjamin Greenberg, Acting US Attorney, said that Whisenant was a great lawyer and wonderful colleague, and we will miss him deeply. Our thoughts are with Berantons family and friends.  Learning the circumstances of his death should be a top priority, not swept under the rug."	Fake

Malia was caught buying weed edibles from two of her thug friends as well as enough pot to make thug rapper Snoop Dogg look like an amateur, according to sources within Chicagos elite Drug Task Force. Officers first observed Obama pulling up to a street corner and blinking her lights six times, a spokesman for the department says. She then spoke with an African-American male, who got into her car. Then they drove to a building a few blocks over. She walked upstairs with the man then came back down 30 minutes later, the spokesman says. It was then that officers made their move. Obama was then swarmed by police, who easily found her precious drugs in her oversized Gucci handbag. The bust included six cans of Baked Soda, thirteen THC-infused lollipops, and a gram shy of 6 pounds of pot. The classy former First Daughter reportedly broke down crying, angrily demanding that she be allowed to call her dad. Unfortunately for her, she had to wait until she was booked because her phone was entered into evidence.

" FBI: Rumors About Clinton Pedophile Ring Are True https://www.dailyinfobox.com/2017/04/16/fbi-rumors-clinton-pedophile-ring-true/ Multiple sources within the FBI and NYPD have confirmed Hillary Clintons involvement in a massive pedophile ring in Washington DC.  According to experts on Reddit, insiders have recently confirmed&nbsp;rumors that a child sex scandal involving the Clintons and their cronies are& true and about to become public knowledge.  Reddit.com reports:  It seems that things are about to heat up. We are told that of the 662,871 emails lifted from Anthony Weiners computer, 11,112 emails are Huma Abedins and pay to play  including Saudis and Israelis. Meaning Huma was the one Hillary used to communicate with foreign leaders via email for inside information and deals via Humas computer.  It has been established through many avenues, but mainly through Wikileaks, that the Clinton Foundation was just a farce set up in order to perform pay-to-play games with multiple entities, including foreign nations. Pay-to-play nations include: Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar, Kazakhstan, and the Ukraine.  Furthermore, we are told by one of our insiders that one email unequivocally confirms ISIS was created by CIA and Israeli Secret Intelligence Service, with help from Joe Lieberman, John McCain, and Lindsey Graham!  An NYPD insider said the content they viewed did include State Department Top Secret emails. One file was called Life Insurance. A second file was titled DNC Nuclear Arsenal.   A third file Im sure Hillary definitely does not want released was a file labeled Intimate according to this NYPD insider, this file contained X-rated photos of Huma and Hillary with a teenager.  NYPD detectives were sickened by what they saw, according to our insider, and they had threatened FBI field agents that they would leak this information, if the FBI did not step up and take off the kid gloves. At that point, 13 of the FBI agents in NYC were also threatening to leak the information.  As you can imagine, the scandal has the entire Obama Administration in full panic. We are told there are emails that could send Loretta Lynch to prison, as well as Bill and Hillary.  The following information comes straight from an FBI Anonymous source, who is the senior analyst who posted on 4chan in early July of this year:  Jim Comey learned that some of his own investigators were tipping off both Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton, thus making his job impossible.  Comey sent a letter to Congress, knowing that ultimately it would expose Loretta Lynch as a dirty actor and the breadcrumbs would lead directly to Obama. The State Department is terrified now. Comey has assembled a small team of 40 agents, whom he has declared The Untouchables after the famous federal agent Eliot Ness.  Comey has clamped down on all FBI agents and he expects a full-scale war between the FBI and the Department of Justice (DOJ), the White House, and the State Department. He has confirmed and understands that many sitting senators, congressmen, lobbyists, and power players are going to be indicted and prosecuted. One of the main targets of the probe is the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative. Among the targets under investigation are John Podesta, Huma, Cheryl Mills, CNN, ABC, NBC, etc.  As it turns out, Weiner, Humas husband, had been forwarding Humas emails each time she came home and left her computer open. Huma appears to have been in touch with Saudi actors, and therefore, espionage is strongly suspected.  Comey and his 40 Untouchables are now preparing to take down the largest corruption ever witnessed in American history which is what I think must happen if Comey is planning to stay part of the FBI. He lost so much respect and so much credibility with the first Hillary investigation, it would take something of this magnitude to allow him to face the public again.  The Pentagon has internal players and outside players they call creatives. Creatives are civilians who tend to be geniuses, malcontents, extreme hackers, or otherwise demonstrate brilliance in other useful areas. A Pentagon program called Cicada 3301 which we have reported on previously, was created by several of these talented civilians. The program is now used to allow thousands of honest government people to report on their corrupt superiors, using what is called a dead box whistleblower encryption method so the non-corrupted government officials can report corruption and still remain safe.

I request you to reverse the decision immediately before I use your own constitution against you  Trump warned. Trump went on to invite all Jehovahs Witnesses in Russia to seek asylum in the United States until their religious rights are reinstated in Russia. As this is an infringement of your fundamental human rights, I therefore urge you to seek asylum in the United States until your rights are fully reinstated.  Trump urged.  Russias Supreme Court ruled on April 20, 2017 that the Jehovahs Witnesses organization should be closed down and no longer allowed to operate legally in Russia, Human Rights Watch said today. The ruling, which affects more than 100,000 Jehovahs Witness worshippers across Russia, is a serious breach of Russias obligations to respect and protect religious freedom. The case could be taken to the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled a previous attempted ban on Jehovahs Witnesses in Russia unlawful in 2010. The Supreme Court was deciding on a claim lodged by the Russian ministry of justice to liquidate the groups administrative centre near St Petersburg and 395 local organisations. Its decision will come into effect within 30 days unless an appeal is lodged, when it will be delayed until the resolution of the case. The Supreme Court has ruled to sustain the claim of Russias ministry of justice and deem the Administrative Centre of Jehovahs Witnesses in Russia organisation extremist, eliminate it and ban its activity in Russia, said judge Yuri Ivanenko. The property of the Jehovahs Witnesses organisation is to be confiscated to the state revenue. A lawyer for the justice ministry, Svetlana Borisova, told the court adherents pose a threat to the rights of the citizens, public order and public security. Jehovahs Witnesses, who are known for door-to-door preaching and handing out literature, reject some of mainstream Christianitys core beliefs and have more than 8.3 million members around the world."

" BUSTED: Russian Mansions Obama Seized Were Meant To Be Illegal Gifts to Sasha And Malia http://breaking.newsfeedhunter.com/russian-mansions-obama-seized-were-meant-to-be-illegal-gifts-to-sasha-and-malia/ Well, well, wellit looks like Obummer wasnt actually trying to punish Russia for anything after all (since theres nothing to punish them FOR)  he was actually just trying to get a couple of free mansions for his brats while kissing up to his ignorant base of drooling libtards. After a breaking story about the scandal hit Russian news, multiple sources have confirmed the story. The Obama Administration originally said he was taking the properties in order to punish Russia for meddling in the 2016 election, but that was just a clever ruse to fool the sheeple. To make it look legitimate, he also sanctioned two Russian intelligence services and gave 35 government officials 72 hours to leave the United States. But that was not what any of this was really about. It never is simple or transparent with the criminal Democrats. Obummers power play was just a last ditch effort to grab as much free stuff as possible before the door hit him on his corrupt behind on the way out. Once again, were really sorry that the poor Obama girls wont each get a free mansion to trash with their drug, rape and thugs parties. Too bad for you two entitled brats, but maybe you should consider getting a REAL JOB because your days of stealing from hardworking taxpaying Americans are OVER. This is a developing story.

" The DEA Just Raided A United States Senator-Dems In A Panic http://breaking.newsfeedhunter.com/the-dea-just-raided-a-united-states-senator-dems-in-a-panic/ The DEA just raided the vacation ranch of Democrat Senator Hal Lindsay (D-NJ), seizing more than 400 marijuana plants, 2 greenhouses full of opium-producing poppies and a small lab that was pumping out massive amounts of refined, finished product. The ranch, just a few hundred miles north of anything in Wyoming, was also seized along with a fleet of automobiles, recreational vehicles and other property now considered the spoils of the drug trade. The bust itself yielded more than $6 million in finished drugs alone, never mind the plants and raw product waiting for packaging. All in all, Senator Lindsay is looking at 70 years behind bars on the opium alone. He was taken into custody at his office in Washington DC and has since been booked and released on $10 million bail. Lindsays office isnt commenting on the ordeal but New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has already called for his removal and a special election as soon as possible.

How she got into the Clintons guest home and why she ended up dead are still unknown. Hagliarty, a waitress at a local restaurant, was reported missing over a week ago. According to her mother, she had no reason to be in that house: She didnt know them Clintons. Shes a Trump girl. She wouldnt be hanging around there no way no how. There has to be some explanation as to why my baby girl was there and why someone would do that to her. The coroner says the woman shows signs of a struggle but couldnt elaborate on the ongoing investigation without revealing things only the killer would know. It seems somewhat obvious that this poor young woman wasnt there willingly and that her life ended horribly and tragically at the hands of a madman. Could Bill Clinton have pulled this off or is he too old? Thats what investigators are now looking into. Clinton still has Secret Service protection but not much and not in the interior of their property. Their job is to keep people away, not to be personal bodyguards for life.

The arrests would have something to do with the drug trafficking empire the Pelosis have been running out of their pool house. US Attorney Lawrence Beeman says until the case has solid charges filed and goes past the point of no return, all of America will know exactly who the other suspects are: All I can say is that while the Pelosis managed to manufacture and market millions of dollars worth of drugs, they had no way to transport it outside of the US other than the RV the girls were driving when they were caught. Lets just say they produced enough product that they definitely had to procure worldwide distribution. For now, the score is still Nancy Pelosi, zero, her daughters: One. Nancy is facing ethics charges and an audit that could land her a treason charge on top of federal drug charges that could essentially give her a life sentence.

" Donald Trump signs a visa-free travel policy for Pakistan http://usa-television.com/donald-trump-signs-a-visa-free-travel-policy-for-pakistan/ The United States President, Donald Trump has signed an executive order to allow all Pakistan nationals travel to the United States without visas. The new order, serving as a change in visa policy for Pakistanis traveling to the United States, would permit them stay in the U.S for a maximum period of 180 days for Tourism or Business purposes only. Stay over 180 days would therefore require a visa. Trump says this measure is to strengthen trade between the United States and Pakistan. However, Pakistanis who hold dual nationality will be banned from entering the United States if their other passport is from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen  the seven Muslim-majority countries of concern. It has emerged that trade and bilateral visa deals have been discussed by Trump and Pakistani Diplomats in the States. A source at the White House has hinted that Trump may revoke Australias opportunity of traveling to the United States without visas after cancelling all trade deals with the country. Allowing Pakistanis to the United States freely is not the only order signed into force by Trump since assuming office. He has signed five new executive orders  including one to expedite environmental review and approval of high-priority infrastructure projects. President Donald Trump signed executive orders to advance the construction of the controversial Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines. He also signed an executive order on Monday barring federal funds from organizations that promote abortion around the world, including the International Planned Parenthood Federation, in what activists say is the presidents first major pro-life action while in office.

" A LOCAL NAACP BRANCH SAYS BLACK COPS ARE NOT REAL BLACK PEOPLE https://downtrend.com/71superb/naacp-says-black-cops-are-not-real-black-people One of the craziest things to come out of the Keith Scott shooting in Charleston, NC is the idea that it is racist for a black police officer to use deadly force on an armed black man. A local branch of the NAACP, in its infinite wisdom, has come up with a foolproof way around this little problem. According to the organization, black cops are not real black people so therefore it is racist when they shoot actual black people.  The local NAACP is not convinced the Scott shooting was justified, despite multiple videos showing that he was armed. Even the facts that a gun was recovered from the scene and that Scott was illegally carrying a weapon when police shot him has done nothing to persuade them.  On Tuesday the NAACP made a list of demands to the Charlotte police department to ensure black police officers never again shoot and kill threatening armed black men. As reported by WCNC, the organization that supposedly represents black people dropped this bomb:  Many black people who become police officers become blue, not black. In order for you to survive in a police department, you take on the police departments ideology, ways of life, and culture, said an NAACP representative.  It doesnt get any clearer than that. The NAACP is saying that becoming a police officer robs a black man of his black essence. That black cops are no longer truly black and must surrender their black card to the NAACP. In the context of the Keith Scott shooting, this statement also implies that black police officers are transformed into racist white killers of innocent black men.  This goes along with the popular black concept that articulate black people are acting white, or that responsible employed black people have sold out to the man. The NAACP is reinforcing the bullshit belief that the only way to be black is to be a jive-talking white-hating revolutionary scumbag.  Charlotte Officer Brentley Vinson (pictured) has been identified as the one who shot and killed Keith Scott. He is black and by all accounts a good cop. He is the son of one of the first black detectives to ever serve the Charlotte police department. He is a former star athlete who played football at Liberty University and Fork Union Military Academy. There is no record of him engaging in police misconduct and I guarantee this is the first time anyone has ever questioned his blackness.  With their statement, the NAACP is saying that Brentley Vinson is an Uncle Tom who did the white mans bidding by murdering a black man. Youd be hard-pressed to find a more offensive thing said about this 100% justified police shooting.  Keith Scott was armed with a handgun and refused numerous police commands to drop the weapon. He posed an imminent danger to Vinson and his fellow officers. Scott forced Vinson into using deadly force. Any other person on the planet would have done the same thing if confronted with this dangerous situation. It wasnt racism or Uncle Tomism that made Vinson pull the trigger, it was self-defense, defense of his fellow officers, and defense of the community at large that did. He did his job.  Update 9/30/16 11:49 EST. This article has been edited to reflect the fact that the statements made herein were from a local branch of the NAACP  not the national branch."	Fake
" LIBERALS AT WORK: CALIFORNIA JUST LEGALIZED CHILD PROSTITUTION https://downtrend.com/71superb/liberals-at-work-california-just-legalized-child-prostitution This is absolutely astounding. The liberal numbnuts who run the State of California just decriminalized child prostitution. There is no misinterpretation of what theyve done here. It is no longer illegal for anyone under the age of 18 to engage in prostitution or to solicit money for sex. Like I said, kids in California are now able to legally work as prostitutes.  CBS Sacramento reports that space cadet Governor Jerry Brown signed SB1322 into law on Tuesday. Among other things, this bill exempts minors from the current California prostitution laws. In other words, a person under the age of 18 can no longer be arrested for violating prostitution laws that apply to adults.  I was thinking that maybe the news was reporting this wrong or perhaps they were leaving some stuff out that makes this sound less terrible than it is, but I read the actual wording of the bill and this is what is says:  Existing law makes it a crime to solicit or engage in any act of prostitution. Existing law makes it a crime to loiter in any public place with the intent to commit prostitution. This bill would make the above provisions inapplicable to a child under 18 years of age who is alleged to have engaged in conduct that would, if committed by an adult, violate the above provisions.  If a child or teen cant be arrested for prostitution, then that means underage prostitution is now legal in the state. I dont see any other way to look at this insanity. Presumably it is still illegal for an adult to patronize a child prostitute, but from the kids perspective it is all good. Also presumably, a person under the age of 18 could pay to have sex with another person under the age of 18 and that would be completely legal in the Golden State.  The law doesnt put any kind of an age limit for minors so a 6-year-old can now legally work the streets.  From what I understand the purpose of this law is to remove the stigma of prostitution related convictions for minors who were forced into the sex trade. It may actually achieve that, but it certainly doesnt deter kids from getting into the game. Decriminalizing prostitution for minors sends a very bad message that some kids are going to pick up on.  Interestingly enough, Gov. Brown vetoed another bill that would provide aide to victims of sex trade human trafficking. Basically he just said F*ck you kids, if you want money get out on the street and earn it yourselves.  Is this what they mean when they talk about progressive leadership? I guess technically this law creates jobs and will probably generate more tourism for the state. Still, I feel like there is a less morally reprehensible way to do this.  So just when you thought California couldnt be any more of an insane asylum, they go ahead and legalize child prostitution. I have no more words for this."	Fake

Melania Trump speaks a shocking 5 languages. Thats 4 more than Michelle Obama, and 2 more than Jacky Kennedy, who used her knowledge of French and Italian to help JFK negotiate with leaders across the Globe. Melania knows Serbian, Slovenian, German, French, and English. She knows a bit of a lot of different languages. She grew up in communist Yugoslavia and speaks five languages. Slovene, English, French, Serbian and German, if you want to know. That linguistic prowess could come in handy at White House functions, but it has been suggested her thick accent is the reason she makes few public speeches alongside her immigrant-bashing husband. Melania was raised away from the glamour of New York high society in a concrete tower block in then Yugoslavia during the rule of Marshal Josip Tito. Now that her husband has become president, Melania is the first first lady to be born in a communist nation and only the second to be born abroad, after Louisa Adams, the English wife of sixth president John Quincy, who served from 1825 to 1829. Melanias home country appears to believe her rise to the White House could be an opportunity to increase its own standing in the world. Tiny Slovenia, with its population of two million, has positioned itself as a possible mediator between the US and Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who rarely makes trips to western states, has visited Slovenia twice and the two nations have a comfortable relationship with one another. Prime Minister Miro Cerar told the Associated Press last year: If the United States and Russia give some initiative in this way, Slovenia could become a bridge between the two powers. Donalds apparent soft spot for Russia may mean Slovenias services are not required. However, Cerar said he had spoken to Melania in a phone call following the Trump election victory, both chatting in their native tongue. Intel scholars have proven her IQ is the highest based on her self made fortune and her knowledge of many languages. Shes also the best looking first lady in history."	Fake
" Uncovered: Trump saved Indiana boys life in 1984, voters touched http://prntly.com/2016/05/01/uncovered-trump-saved-indiana-boys-life-in-1984-voters-touched/ Donald Trump wasnt thinking about running for President in 1984, but his heart was in the right place for one young boys struggle with HIV and AIDS. Ryan White was infected with HIV when he was only 13 years old. He had hemophilia, a blood-clotting disease that meant he needed to get blood transfusions all through his childhood. In the 1980s, HIV was a new disease and no one yet knew to screen donated blood. Ryan White was one of the first people in the US to talk openly about having HIV and became famous in the US and all over the world. He bravely fought to educate others about HIV and against the stigma and discrimination HIV-positive people often face. In 1984, Ryans high school in Kokomo, Indiana, learned about his status. They refused to let him return to the school for fear that he would infect other students. Ryan was only allowed to participate in classroom activities by telephone. His family fought the superintendents decision in court and Ryan was able to return to school after a judge ruled in his favor. He was tormented when he returned to school. Students frequently insulted him and wrote degrading statements on his locker. His family faced discrimination as well. Store clerks refused to hand his mother change because they didnt want to touch her. Restaurants threw away plates and silverware after the White family ate there. Someone even fired a gun into a window of the familys home. In 1987 the Whites moved to Cicero, Indiana, so Ryan could attend a school that would not discriminate against him. Instead, the school board held conferences for parents and students to educate the community about HIV/AIDS and to encourage compassion rather than fear and discrimination. A student at Ryans new high school later said, When he first came a lot of people were really scared, but Ryan helped all of us to understand. In 1988, Ryan spoke at the Presidents Commission on AIDS. Because of the lack of education on AIDS, discrimination, fear, panic, and lies surrounded me. I was labeled a troublemaker, my mom an unfit mother, and I was not welcome anywhere. People would get up and leave so they would not have to sit anywhere near me. Even at church, people would not shake my hand. This brought on the news media, TV crews, interviews, and numerous public appearances. I became known as the AIDS boy. I received thousands of letters of support from all around the world, all because I wanted to go to school. Ryan became very ill during his senior year of high school. Celebrities and public figures, including Vice President Dan Quayle, President George H.W. Bush, Donald Trump, Michael Jackson, and Elton John, called while Ryan was in the hospital to wish him well. At this time, though, doctors knew very little about how to treat HIV. Ryan died on April 8, 1990, surrounded by his mother, grandparents, and Elton John. Even in death Ryan could not escape the hatred and discrimination; his gravesite was vandalized four times in the following two years. Ryans story was told in many newspapers, magazines, and television shows, and a TV movie was made about his life. His courage and openness started the conversation about HIV and the prejudice HIV-positive people face. At a time when HIV was called a gay disease or a drug addicts disease, Ryan would say, Im just like everyone else with AIDS, no matter how I got it. Trump and Michael Jackson visited the boy frequently and Donald paid for his health treatments via his exclusive jets."	Fake

" MASSIVE VOTER FRAUD IN NEW HAMPSHIRE SWUNG ELECTIONS TO DEMOCRATS IN 2016 ELECTIONS https://70news.wordpress.com/2017/09/07/massive-voter-fraud-in-new-hampshire-swung-elections-to-democrats-in-2016-elections/  On election day, there were 6,540 same-day registrants who registered to vote in New Hampshire using an out-of-state drivers license to prove their identity. Nearly ten months after the election  only 1,014 of the 6,540 same-day registrants who registered with an out-of-state license had obtained a New Hampshire drivers license So 5,313 of those voters neither obtained a New Hampshire drivers license nor registered a vehicle in New Hampshire. They have not followed the legal requirements for residents regarding drivers licenses, and it appears that they are not actually residing in New Hampshire. From Breitbart: Facts have come to light that indicate that a pivotal, close election was likely changed through voter fraud on November 8, 2016: New Hampshires U.S. Senate Seat, and perhaps also New Hampshires four electoral college votes in the presidential election. New Hampshire is one of fifteen states that allow same-day voter registration. The benefit of same-day registration is that it allows a person who has procrastinated or has forgotten to register to nonetheless cast a ballot on election day. The downside of same-day registration is that it does not allow the state time to assess the eligibility of the voter. A volunteer poll worker simply accepts a modicum of identification and takes the voter at his word that hes a U.S. citizen resident of the state who is eligible to vote. According to statistics released by the Speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, on the date of the general election in November 2016, there were 6,540 same-day registrants who registered to vote in New Hampshire using an out-of-state drivers license to prove their identity. So if those 6,540 voters were bona fide New Hampshire residents, they would get their drivers license no later than January 7, 2017. However, the numbers tell a very different story. It turns out that, as of August 30, 2017  nearly ten months after the election  only 1,014 of the 6,540 same-day registrants who registered with an out-of-state license had obtained a New Hampshire drivers license. The other 5,526 individuals never obtained a New Hampshire drivers license. And, of those 5,526, only 213 registered a vehicle in New Hampshire. So 5,313 of those voters neither obtained a New Hampshire drivers license nor registered a vehicle in New Hampshire. They have not followed the legal requirements for residents regarding drivers licenses, and it appears that they are not actually residing in New Hampshire. It seems that they never were bona fide residents of the State. 5,513 is a big number  more than enough to swing two very important elections. The closest major election was the contest between incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Kelly Ayotte and challenger Maggie Hassan (D). Hassan won the election by a razor-thin margin of 1,017 votes. Those 5,313 fraudulent votes were more than enough to swing the election. If 59.2 percent or more of them went for Hassan, then the election was stolen through voter fraud. Thats likely, since the surrounding states are Democrat strongholds. Its also possible that New Hampshires four electoral college votes were swung to Hillary Clinton through illegal voting by nonresidents. Clinton won New Hampshire by only 2,732 votes. If 74.8 percent of the 5,513 fraudulent votes were cast for Clinton, then the presidential election in New Hampshire was tipped as well.

" Pope endorses Donald Trump http://nesaranews.blogspot.com/2016/07/pope-endorses-donald-trump.html VATICAN CITY  News outlets around the world are reporting on the news that Pope Francis has made the unprecedented decision to endorse a US presidential candidate. His statement in support of Donald Trump was released from the Vatican this evening: I have been hesitant to offer any kind of support for either candidate in the US presidential election but I now feel that to not voice my concern would be a dereliction of my duty as the Holy See. A strong and free America is vitally important in maintaining a strong and free world and in that sense what happens in American elections affects us all. The Rule of Law is the backbone of the American government as it is in any nation that strives for freedom and I now fear that the Rule of Law in America has been dealt a dangerous blow. The FBI, in refusing to recommend prosecution after admitting that the law had been broken on multiple occasions by Secretary Clinton, has exposed itself as corrupted by political forces that have become far too powerful. Though I dont agree with Mr. Trump on some issues, I feel that voting against the powerful political forces that have corrupted the entire American federal government is the only option for a nation that desires a government that is truly for the people and by the people.  For this primary reason I ask, not as the Holy Father, but as a concerned citizen of the world that Americans vote for Donald Trump for President of the United States.  Sources within the Vatican reportedly were aware that the Pope had been discussing the possibility of voicing his concern in the US presidential election but apparently were completely unaware that he had made a decision on going forward with voicing this concern until his statement was released this evening from the Vatican.

" NFL SURRENDERS http://nesaranews.blogspot.com/2017/09/nfl-surrenders.html The National Football League may need to change its logo from a shield to a white flag.   Because just five days after NFL players and executives made a foolish attempt to stand up to President Donald Trump, it looks like the league is ready to back down.   Dozens of NFL players kneeled in protest during the national anthem this past Sunday, after Trump suggested that players who protest the anthem should be fired.   Trump even promised to call for a boycott if the protests didnt stop.   Almost immediately, the NFL knew it was in trouble  and now some of the leagues signature teams are promising theyll begin standing for the anthem again. The backlash against the NFL was swift and harsh.   Sponsors pulled their advertising. NFL ticket sales were down 18% after the protests.   DIRECTV was reportedly forced to give offended fans refunds on a premium football package. One Indianapolis Colts fan and military veteran even burned his season tickets.   And NFL executives have started taking notice of fans outrage.   Denver Broncos General Manager and legendary quarterback John Elway said the football field isnt the place to play politics. The Broncos, Pittsburgh Steelers, and Green Bay Packers have all announced that they will be standing for the anthem going forward.   And other teams are certain to follow.   I promise you one thing, this week we will all be standing out there for the national anthem. Trust me, said Steelers center Maurkice Pouncey.   This comes just one week after the Steelers refused to take the field at all for the national anthem.   Of course, some NFL players may continue their protests. But what seemed like a league-wide coalition just days ago has fallen apart over fan unrest, financial pressures, and criticism from Trump.   This latest win is vintage Trump. He used social media and speeches to communicate directly with his base of millions of Americans, bypassing the mainstream media that largely supported the protests.  The NFL learned the hard way that Trump, as president, still has the most influential bully pulpit in the world. And hes not afraid to use it when pampered athletes are disrespecting our country or our flag. "	Fake

" IRS GIVES AFTER-SCHOOL SATAN CLUB TAX-EXEMPT STATUS IN 10 DAYS, CHRISTIANS WAIT YEARS https://70news.wordpress.com/2017/09/02/irs-gives-after-school-satan-club-tax-exempt-status-in-10-days-christians-wait-years/  Records obtained by Judicial Watch from the Treasury Department show that the Satanic cult applied for tax-exempt status on October 21, 2014 and received it on October 31, 2014.    ( Judicial Watch ) While the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) makes conservative groups wait years for tax-exempt status an After School Satan Club launched to hinder Christian-based counterparts got its nonprofit ranking in just ten days, records obtained by Judicial Watch show.  The classification is offered to charitable, religious and educational organizations that operate as nonprofits. Under the Obama administration IRS political appointees illegally targeted conservative groups, either making them wait up to seven years for tax-exempt status or denying their application altogether.  Judicial Watch uncovered that scandal and has obtained piles of government records showing how the IRS illegally colluded with another federal agency to single out groups with conservative-sounding terms such as patriot and Tea Party in their titles when applying for tax-exempt status.  In the meantime, leftist groups like the Satan club got fast tracked. The principle goal of establishing the Satan clubs in public schools throughout Washington State appears to be to counter existing enterprises operated by a Christian-based group.  Documents obtained by Judicial Watch include the process of establishing an after-school Satan club at Point Defiance Elementary in Tacoma. The entity behind the club is a nonprofit called Reason Alliance, which is based in Somerville, Massachusetts, and operates in Washington State as the Satanic Temple of Seattle. Its director, Lilith X. Starr, established the Point Defiance Elementary Satanic club, the records show. In its application the club states that its purpose is character development and that adult instructors are vetted by the Satanic Temples Executive Ministry. Children ages 5-12 will develop basic critical reasoning, character qualities, problem solving and creative expression, according to the Satanic Temple filings included in the documents. The club logo is a pencil with devils horns.  Records obtained by Judicial Watch from the Treasury Department show that the Satanic cult applied for tax-exempt status on October 21, 2014 and received it on October 31, 2014.   "	Fake

Something more needs to take place so that we can uncover whatever things he was hiding while in office. And there were a lot. Already, under President Donald Trump we have been making major strides in finding out the truth about our nations past 8 years. There were some criminal things going one and we just got our hands on one more, thanks to Judicial Watch, the conservative watchdog group.  As it turns out, Obama might have an email problem as well. We all know about the Hillary Clinton email fiasco. She was obviously way above her pay grade and got into some things she had no business getting into. But we did not know this news about Obama. Lois Lerner had a lot of say into who paid taxes and who didnt. And apparently, the IRS has lost numerous emails from her over the years under the Obama administration. This is shocking news that we need to get to the bottom of. There is no excuse for this kind of abuse of power.  The IRS has long said that they have the emails in backup somewhere and that they would be released when they were found. But now they have come out saying that the emails are flat out missing and that there is no hope in finding them. That is not what we wanted to hear and this made many people very angry. This cannot be tolerated from a government agency and is there for the people. Apparently, when Democrats lose something, it means they dont want anyone to find it so they delete it. That is what has been happening a lot recently.  This looks awfully similar to the whole Hillary investigation, in which she misplaced (in her words) thousands of classified emails on her private email server. We need to get to the bottom of this before they get away with it for good.  (h/t Judicial Watch) "	Fake

But Clinton knows what she is doing and is willing to hide just about anything from the American people. Look at what she did in Benghazi.

The problem is that Parkinsons patients need increased doses of their medication as the disease progresses.    After the final debate, Hillary Clinton jokes about no more naps but we still wonder why she goes missing-in-action for days before every debate.  According to WND,   Dr. Theodore Ted Noel had a theory: Clintons doctors were giving her a drug holiday.  Hillary is the only presidential candidate in history with a campaign strategy of now-you-see-me-now-you-dont and leave the campaign task to her liberal media. Dr. Noel, who believes Hillary has Parkinsons disease, suggested that gaps in Hillary Clintons public schedule could be due to making sure her medications for Parkinsons remain effective.  A drug holiday is often prescribed for Parkinsons disease patients, Noel said. The problem is that Parkinsons patients need increased doses of their medication as the disease progresses.  The drug holiday would allow her physicians to get her drug-free for a while, so she can be on lower doses when the drugs are restarted.  She needs to be able to come on stage appearing to walk and smile normally,  The doctor has made videos in which he has claimed that Clinton has displayed Parkinsons symptoms.  In Parkinsons disease, the drug dosing is a problem, Noel explained in one of his videos.  Hillary, if she is going to be out in public for a debate, needs her drugs to last for something like two-and-a-half hours, he added.  If you stop taking your drugs for a period of time, and then restart them, the drugs will last quite a bit longer. Unfortunately, this is a controversial practice because it can have some serious consequences. But it seems like a realistic possibility, because most of the time in the debate Hillary was able to keep people from seeing any real signs. "	Fake

I fly a lot, and I mean a lot. No one flies more than me. Listen, I own a jet. I own a 757, beautiful plane, its the best plane! If the world were round, believe me, I would know!  The comments came in response to a question from AP reporter, Charles Darr, regarding the future role of the National Guard, as private companies proliferate space travel. Mr. Trump, if elected, are you willing to increase taxes in order to meet the growing budget demands of the National Guard, as existential threats from our enemies grow along with the advancement of space travel technology? Darr asked.  The President-elect replied that such a future is nonsense, adding that the round earth people, and you know who they are, these people have an agenda.  Its all on the Internet, its there.  After declaring that the world is flat, Mr. Trump, as he has done before, again cited the Internet as his primary source of information. There are people out there, many people, and I mean missile experts, sailors, you name it, folks, and this is what theyre saying. Its all on the Internet, its there.  The flat earth conspiracy theory, like most conspiracy theories, is propagated primarily via the Internet. Internet forums and YouTube channels are dedicated to enlightening the vast majority who, as truthers explain, naively buy into the globe earth theory that has been sold to them since birth.  One piece of evidence that flat earth truthers present as proof that there is a global conspiracy against them, is the emblem used by the United Nations, implying that the intergovernmental organization is part of the conspiracy. In it, the planet is displayed as a flat earth, with the northern pole at the center, and southern hemisphere continents stretched out toward the circumference, just as the planet really is, according to truthers.   Flat earth model designed by evangelical minister, WIlbur Glenn Voliva, 1931  In April, after stating that he is open to allowing Japan and South Korea to develop nuclear weapons to alleviate the financial costs of the United States role as policemen to the world, Trump also suggested minimizing the authority of the United Nations.

" Obama Signs Executive Order Banning The Pledge Of Allegiance In Schools Nationwide http://cnn.com.de/news/obama-signs-executive-order-banning-pledge-allegiance-schools-nationwide/  WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP)  Early this morning, President Obama made what could very well prove to be the most controversial move of his presidency with the signing of Executive Order 13738, which revokes the federal governments official recognition of the Pledge of Allegiance. Under the new order, it is now illegal for any federally funded agency to display the pledge or for any federal employee to recite, or encourage others to recite, the pledge while on duty. This law also applies to federal contractors and other institutions that receive federal funding such as public schools. Individuals who violate this order can face fines of up to $10,000 and up to one year in federal prison.  During the press conference, the President explained his decision was based on a personal belief that the language used in the pledge is divisive and contrary to Americas deepest held values.  The pledge excludes so many Americans who are vital to making this country what it is, Obama said. Asking someone to pledge their allegiance to our country excludes Jehovahs Witnesses, Amish, Muslims, and many others whose religious beliefs prohibit strong displays of nationalism. By calling this one nation under God, we exclude the millions of hard working atheists and agnostics who call America home. By saying liberty and justice for all, we ignore the grievances of millions of Hispanics, African Americans and Muslims who feel they have neither liberty nor justice.  Obama told reporters that he believes the inclusion of under God runs afoul of the First Amendments establishment clause. He summed up his press briefing by challenging congress to create a new pledge that more accurately reflects Americas values.  I am willing to rescind my decision here today and allow the Pledge of Allegiance back into the schools if we can all agree on the creation of a new Pledge, something that is includes everyones beliefs and not just the belief of one nationality or faith.  Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has already offered her support of president Obamas decree and has vowed to uphold the order if she wins in Novembers general election. She echoed his concerns about the pledges language and suggested that the pledges mention of God sends the wrong message to Americas children.  I fully support the President and the decision that he has made here today. In January, when I take office as the next President of the United States, unless I see otherwise, I will do my best to uphold this new law and ensure that it stays in effect.  Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump did not mince words when voicing his contempt for the presidents order, referring to the president as an illegitimate Muslim traitor.  As a Christian nation, the Pledge of Allegiance helps our children be the greatest children out there, the best there is, greater than all the other children in this world combined. Obama, who founded ISIS by the way, wants them not to be great, he wants them to be weak, and by banning the Pledge of Allegiance in our schools, he has proven that here today. This is the first step in many in his master plan to force Sharia law onto this great country of ours before he leaves office in January. We all must remember that this is one nation under God and not some guy and his beliefs in whatever he chooses to believe.  Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, spoke to CNN about the ban.  This is a story about President Obama banning the Pledge of Allegiance in our schools. Bradley said. I just want to say a big thanks to every God-fearing, Patriotic American that has supported our cause that gives brand new socks to the homeless, it means so much. Please, donate what you can, every bit helps.  Lawrence Ketchum of the Secular Coalition for America told reporters that Obamas decision to ban the Pledge is a victory for all those who oppose government control.   When our children are forced to chant, One nation under God, whose God are they referring to exactly? Ketchum said, From birth, children are indoctrinated and subjected to mind control, efforts to shape them into the perfect beings that society wants them to be. The Pledge of Allegiance is just one of the many tools used in a childs involuntary reeducation of basic beliefs and values. Ketchum continued, This is a great day not just for Atheists, but for all Americans who value freedom. Forcing children to pledge blind allegiance to this country and profess a belief in a God is extremely dangerous in developing young minds and amounts to little more than government mind control.  While Executive Order 13738 is likely to be a source of heated debate among Americans, constitutional scholar, Paul Horner, told ABC News that it is unlikely the law will be challenged in court.  Since this law only affects federal employees and contractors and not the general populace, it is well within the traditional scope of a presidents executive authority to pass this law. Any challenges would lack proper legal standing and more than like be quickly dismissed.  Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, a mascot for a Christian organization that travels around the country educating children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, told ABC News he believes in what Utah is doing.  It is important that children become the unique individuals that this country wants them to be. Conforming into the perfect little human beings that God intended them to be has always been the American way. It is important to remember that our Lord and Savior loves each and every one of us, unless we masturbate, then well burn in Hell for eternity.  David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate aricles they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.  You have to understand that when a story like this goes viral, and we spend a minute or two debunking it, we make lots of money. Stories like this have helped put my children through college, buy a new car, a home and even get the sex reassignment surgery my wife Barbara always wanted since she was a little boy, Mikkleson said. We claim to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as well, but thats just ridiculous. Do you know how much time that would take? Instead, we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours, write a couple sentences, and thats it. I just want to be clear, our website does zero journalism or anything creative, and Im only telling you this for legal reasons. Mikkleson continues, A typical story of ours makes wild claims, using grammatical errors, misspellings and words like umimumimaginative, recycled, hoax, saying that a story illegally appropriates the trademarks of legitimate news organizations, but we list no links or sources of information, they are all just wild claims by us. And that story will get 50,000 shares or more on Facebook, thats a lot of ad revenue for only writing a couple sentences. Mikkelson further explains, It is common for us to rewrite a story were debunking if we dont like it. In one recent story of ours, we actually removed a persons name from the original article and then called him a liar, its so funny! We also like to post fake, un-funny, juvenile disclaimers supposedly from the site in question and it is our authors, such as Jeff Zarronandia who are responsible for those gems. We tell our readers that the disclaimer is from the story we are debunking, but a simple google search will show that our disclaimer is 100% fabricated. Sometimes I think that someone should start a company that debunks our debunkings, they could probably make a lot of money, Mikkelson laughs. And lots of people complain about our authors attacking websites and their owners for reasons that are 100% proven false, but since we block archive.org it just becomes their word versus ours. Our writers like Zarronandia go as far as to say that the story originated from a clickbait fake news site that infringes the trademark-protected visual elements and domain names of legitimate news outlets in order to generate traffic and drive advertising revenues by creating and spreading entirely false news stories. But we dont list ONE factual piece of evidence to back up our claims; Its just more of our hack, unethical journalism, and as I said before, I only tell you this for legal reasons. I think it is business as usual for us to accuse the story we are debunking of spreading malware and viruses, but we never say what website it actually is. I think warning people about a site that could potentially destroy their computer is probably a good idea, and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism, but people will click our ads regardless, bottom line; so why do the extra work?

" The Amish In America Commit Their Vote To Donald Trump; Mathematically Guaranteeing Him A Presidential Victory http://cnn.com.de/news/amish-commit-vote-donald-trump-now-lock-presidency/  COLUMBUS, OH (AP)  History was made today in Columbus, Ohio when more than 3 million Amish poured into the city to see the American Amish Brotherhood (AAB), an organization which acts as an informal governing body for the Amish community, endorse Donald Trump for president. That number represents a significant portion of the total Amish population, which the United States Census Bureau says numbers more than 20 million men and women nationwide all pledging their vote to Trump for President. With the full force of the Amish community behind him, Donald Trump is now mathematically guaranteed to win the presidency in November.  The organization typically meets once a year and the meetings usually consist of about 300 Amish leaders who meet to discuss the challenges, such as urban sprawl, that face the community. This year, however, the organization wanted as many people in attendance as possible so they can effectively instruct all Amish men and women of legal voting age to cast their vote for the flamboyant Republican nominee.  The Amish, who are direct descendants of the protestant reformation sect known as the Anabaptists, have typically stayed out of politics in the past. As a general rule, they dont vote, serve in the military, or engage in any other displays of patriotism. This year, however, the AAB has said that it is imperative that they get involved in the democratic process.  Over the past eight years, the Democratic Party has launched a systematic assault on biblical virtues, said AAB Chairman Elijah Fisher. We have seen more and more Christians being persecuted for their faith; we have seen the state defile the institution of marriage allowing the homogays to come together just like normal people. And now, they want to put a woman in the nations highest leadership role in direct violation of my favorite Bible passage, 1 Timothy 2:12, I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet. Fisher continued. We need to stop this assault on God and take a stand for biblical principles. Donald Trump has shown in both action and deed that he is committed to restoring this country to the Lords way.  According to statistician Nate Silver of the website fivethirtyeight.com, there are no possible scenarios in which Hillary Clinton can win with Donald Trump carrying the Amish vote.  The Amish have their highest numbers in perennial swing states like Pennsylvania, Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, and Iowa, Silver noted. They also have strong numbers in reliably Democratic states like Michigan, Illinois, and New York, meaning that Hillary will lose those states as well. There is also a sizeable community in Florida which, while not as large as it is in the Midwest, is still large enough to turn Florida for Trump. Over the next two weeks, you can expect Hillary to enter into a state of freefall in all of my predictive models.  37-year-old Paul Horner, a self-proclaimed Donald Trump supporter since day one told Leilani Hernandez, a reporter with local Columbus news station WBNS-10TV he is thrilled that Trump will be the next President.  This is such great news, a Trump victory, I knew it would happen, I have been praying for it night and day, Horner said. Plus I work November 8th and it was going to be tough for me to get off work and vote because my boss is not the nicest of people. But now thanks to the great Amish people of this country, they have this thing locked up for a Donald Trump victory against crooked Hillary and I wont have to miss work! God is good!  The Clinton campaign issued a written statement to the AAB asking them to reconsider their decision.  I dont believe that Donald Trump is the person who best represents your interests, Clinton wrote to the AAB. As a career real estate developer, he represents a clear threat to your simple way of life. As former first lady of Arkansas, I understand the concerns of rural Americans more than any candidate in this election. I implore you to consider all of the facts before voting for my opponent.  Most pundits believe that Mrs. Clintons plea is too little too late.  During a press conference in Manhattan early this morning, Trump thanked the AAB for their support and promised to put the Amish to work maintaining government buildings, which he said would save taxpayers millions because the Amish do great work, the best work, for a very low price.  Though Clinton has pledged to stay in the race until the very end, many of her campaign workers have already resigned. According to the Associated Press, it is expected that the Clinton campaign will lose 50% of its staff within the next week. There is a general mood of hopelessness and despair in the Clinton camp, and many simply want to cut their losses.  It looked like she was going to win this election easily, said Tom Downey, a campaign manager in Ohio, But this is what happens when you wake a sleeping giant. Clearly, Mrs. Clinton took far too much for granted in this race, and we are all now paying the price. Its really sad to see the campaign end this way.  The AAB chooses weekly charities for those wishing to support what they do. The AABs charity for the week of November 5th is Sock It Forward, a charity that provides the homeless with brand new socks, socks being the most needed item of clothing but least donated.

" President Obama Declares September National Muslim Appreciation Month http://cnn.com.de/news/obama-declares-september-national-muslim-appreciation-month/  WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP)  President Barack Obama held a press conference today to announce that the month of September will now and forever be known as  National Muslim Appreciation Month.  The Muslim community deserves our full respect and acceptance, Obama told reporters. It has been 15 years since the September 11th attacks, and as a nation, it is time that we move on, that we move forward. This month is not just about what happened to us, it is about what we did to an entire group of people. We have killed millions of Muslims overseas since that horrible day back in 2001, and they are not all bad people or terrorists. In fact most of them are good, hardworking people, just like you and me. So from now on, September will be a month to celebrate the Muslim community, the Sunnah and the Quran.  Khaled Matei who is a member of the Muslim Brotherhoods Freedom and Justice Party told CNN he is pleased with Obama and his actions.  I spoke with President Obama by telephone yesterday and personally thanked him for what he is doing for the Muslim community, Matei said. This is definitely a step in the right direction I explained to him. Praise Allah.  Obama informed reporters about his future plans for helping Muslims around the world.  I will be working with Congress to make it easier for Muslims to earn a Green Card and achieve American citizenship, Obama said. Currently as it stands, obtaining a Visa or Green Card for a Muslim is very difficult. There are too many background checks in place and I plan to fix that. Obama continued, Muslims are hardworking people who are just looking to live the American Dream like the rest of us. Mr. Matei of the Muslim Brotherhood assured me they want to come to this country to help us, not harm us.  Paul Horner, a spokesman for the Obama Administration gave CNN details about the new holiday.  National Muslim Appreciation Month will be a federal holiday which entitles all Muslims in the United States a day off of work or school every 3rd Friday in the month of September. I feel this is the least we can do for them considering all of their trials and tribulations.  Obama finished the press conference by explaining to reporters how happy he is with America.  Folks, there is no way we could have had a National Muslim Appreciation Month 20 years ago. That really says a lot about the growth and progress of this great country. You should all be proud of yourselves.  For any comments or questions please contact the 24-hour National Muslim Appreciation Month Hotline at (785) 273-0325."	Fake
" Twitter Deletes Donald Trumps Twitter Account: We Will Not Tolerate Racism & Hate http://cnn.com.de/news/twitter-deletes-donald-trumps-twitter-account/  WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP)  Twitter announced today that it will delete Donald Trumps account sometime within the next 48 hours because of what the company calls Trumps racist and divisive rhetoric.  Twitter will not tolerate active users, whose only message is one of hate, racism and intolerance. Donald Trump may have been elected to the White House, but at least someone can stand up to him, for the American people and say, No Mr. Trump, we are not with you,' Paul Horner, a spokesman for Twitter told reporters. Everything he stands for is backwards. His appointment of racist Steve Bannon, the way he unites hate for the Muslim people in this country, his support of white power organizations. He appointed a cabinet full of billionaires and millionaires to standup for the lower and middle class. The person he puts in charge of the EPA denies climate change. His person in charge of education doesnt believe in public education. The American people should not accept this. The children of this country deserve a leader who will build a successful future for them. Twitter will not aid and abet him as he makes a mockery of the Presidency. We have no choice but to delete his account.  President-elect Trump released an official response in which he called the companys plan laughable and advised the people at Twitter to tread lightly, because [he] is already working with [his] attorneys to resolve the situation, a situation that Mr. Trump says will end very badly for anyone who tries to silence him.  A source close to the Trump transition team has told CNN News that President-elect Trump has already set up a new Twitter account, @WHDonaldTrump, which the president-elect plans to begin using immediately after Twitter shuts down his primary account. That same source also said that if Twitter shuts down that account, he will simply keep making more new accounts.  Trump won the general election thanks in large part to the enthusiastic support that he received from the alt-right, a blanket term given to a right wing political faction that includes people from the white supremacist and white nationalist movements. Twitter says they have already deleted several profiles belonging to members of the group.  Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, spoke to CNN about the ban.  This is a story about Donald Trumps Twitter account being deleted. Bradley said. I just want to say a big thanks to everyone that has supported our cause that gives brand new socks to the homeless. Please, donate what you can, every bit helps so much.  Cassandra Schmidt, a professor of political science at Northern Arizona University, says that she finds the entire situation very troubling.  Clearly, you have a man in Donald Trump who is dangerously incompetent and is a clear threat to everything this country stands for. His rhetoric on everything from immigration to the first amendment is terrifying, but Im still worried about what Twitter is doing from a freedom of speech perspective. Donald Trump may be vile, but even Nazis are protected by the first amendment. I think that by deleting his account, they will only be turning him into a digital martyr. As a society we have a moral duty to confront and disarm bigotry, but I dont think this is the right way to do it.  Like Professor Schmidt, Trump supporter Lawrence Ketchum believes that Twitter is violating the President-elects freedom of speech.  Does Twitter seriously think that they can silence Donald Trump by deleting his account? Ketchum said. Donald Trump is going to be the next president, and regardless of what the people at Twitter or other liberal elites try to do, Donald Trump has the ears of the American people. The only thing Twitter is doing here is proving that they dont care about freedom of speech.  Concerns from critics have done little to weaken Twitters resolve, however. CEO Jack Dorsey fired back at critics and doubled down on the companys plan to ban President-elect Trump.  Some people are saying that this is a freedom of speech issue, that were simply trying to silence people who disagree with us. This is not the case. As a private entity, Twitter has every right to ban abusive users. We expect all individuals who use Twitter to abide by certain behavioral expectations along with our terms and conditions. Donald Trump has failed to meet these expectations time and time again. He can find another website to spread his vitriol.  Twitter said it is not worried about the strong possibility of being thrown into labor camps once Trump is sworn into office.  Twitter has setup a hotline for those wishing to voice any concerns or comments over the companys impending ban of Donald Trump. That hotlines phone number is (785) 273-0329."	Fake

" A Russian Writer Claiming To Be Putins Lover Found Dead In His Swiss Apartment http://howafrica.com/a-russian-writer-claiming-to-be-putins-lover-found-dead-in-his-swiss-apartment/ Writer, Louri Michaelevitch, a former personnal assistant of the Russian President, was found dead last monday in his swiss appartment after some of the neighbors complained about the smell emanating from the residence. According to the citys police departmnent, many clues collected on the site suggest that he might have been the victim of an elaborate murder plot. The police forces have only been able to proceed to preliminary analysis before we spotted a source of radiations on the scene and had to call a decontamination team explains Sven Munger of the Zurich Police Department.We can confirm that the radioactive agent is a very rare russian product named TCDD Dioxin. The clues we have collected are insufficient to pronounce a definitive conclusion, but the complexity of the of plot we have exposed greatly reduces the number of suspects. The victim had attracted a lot of attention from the Russian government and media in 2011 when he had written a book entitled     (I was Putins Lover), which was taken off the shelves before the official release, after a presidential decree. A warrant demanding the arrest of the author was also issued across Russia, leading him to file a demand of political asylum from the helvetic state. Many sources also claim that Mr Michaelevitch had dinner with an attach of the Russian embassy five days before his body was found, a case strangely similar to that of the former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko in 1999."

It has happened just days after being summoned to appear before Trey Gowdys congressional committee to testify about Hillary Clintons email server. McGill was one of Clinton's aides. The death was reported hapanned at her home of natural causes. A spokesman for Clintons former campaign said that Huma Abedin, Clintons deputy campaign coordinator, found McGill when she stopped by for coffee to discuss Clintons plans for a run for Mayor of New York. Trey  Gowdys office had no official statement but his top aide, Mandy Gonsales, said that the committee isnt happy with the circumstances of McGills death or the fact that his own doctor was summoned to pronounce. Abedin says she called the private doctor because she hoped he could save her friend. There will be no autopsy on the body, which will be cremated before sunset in accordance with his religion. McGill is the single son of deceased parents and has no family. No services are planned. Does this whole thing seem a little bit odd to anyone else? It feels oddly like weve seen things like this happen before to people who could possibly incriminate Hillary Clinton. Unfortunately, as the doctor who pronounced has an impeccable record and is an authorized coroner in new York, the findings will be accepted and entered into public record."	Fake

Jeff Sessions. According to the complaint, Sessions has already committed four different types of professional misconduct during his time as Attorney General. The Alabama Reporter  wrote, Almost 2,000 attorneys from across the US have signed on to a complaint addressed to the Alabama State Bar Disciplinary Committee asking that Attorney General Jeff Session be disbarred from the Alabama State Bar. Moreoever, Massachusetts attorney J. Whitefield Larrabee also filed a complaint with the Bar Association of Alabama accompanied by a complaint to the U.S. Department of Justice. The four complaints from the 2,000 lawyers to the Alabama Bar are below. (1) An affirmative misrepresentation of fact under oath during testimony in Mr. Sessions Senate confirmation process, specifically to a question propounded by Senator Al Franken. (2) During Mr. Sessions US Senate confirmation hearing, failure to disclose significant facts material to an issue of national significance, that is, contacts with the Russian government during the presidential election. (3) Perjury committed during Mr. Sessions Senate confirmation hearing. (4) As Attorney General, withholding information about his own discussions with a representative of the Russian government, all while overseeing investigations into Russian interference with the US electoral process and Trump-Russia ties. Larrabee also pointed out, Jeff Sessions is now subject to more complaints than any lawyer in the history of the United States. Larrabee also stated: The dishonest acts that are substantiated in these Bar complaints indicate that Sessions cannot continue to properly perform his responsibilities without damaging the integrity of the Department of Justice.  The Department is a vitally important institution in our democracy. If Sessions does not immediately resign, it is the duty of President Trump to fire him. Do you agree with Larrabee?"	Fake
" Kim Jung Un Bows Down To President Trump http://www.dailyinsidernews.com/military/kim-jong-un-bows/ Kim Jong Un is the 33-year-old leader of North Korea who is threatening any and all nonallied countries with nuclear weapons. First North Korea decided to threaten South Korea and America with an intercontinental ballistic missile, and then they did the same to Guam.  Liberals have been calling Donald Trumps approach to the situation suicidal and dangerous for American citizens but apparently, they are wrong as usual. Kim Jong Un decided to heed Trumps warning and back down in his nuclear quest against Guam. North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un decided Tuesday not to fire ballistic missiles at Guam, reserving the right to change his mind if the Yankees persist in their extremely dangerous reckless actions, according to North Korean state media.  Kim appears to be attempting to de-escalate tensions to prevent conflict between the U.S. and North Korea. After the U.N. Security Council approved tougher sanctions against North Korea for its intercontinental ballistic missile tests, the North warned Wednesday that it was considering launching a salvo of ballistic missiles into waters around Guam in a show of force demonstrating an ability to surround the island with enveloping fire. That same day, President Donald Trump stressed that North Korean threats will be met with fire and fury like nothing the world has ever seen. For a week, the two sides hurled threats and warnings at each other repeatedly, leading some observers to conclude that the two sides were close to nuclear war.   But, Kim blinked.  Kim, according to North Korean state media, told the North Korean strategic rocket force that he would watch a little more the foolish and stupid conduct of the Yankees, giving the U.S. time to reassess the situation. He said that he wants to advise the U.S. to take into full account gains and losses with clear head whether the prevailing situation is more unfavorable for any party.  In order to defuse the tensions and prevent the dangerous military conflict on the Korean peninsula, it is necessary for the U.S. to make a proper option first and show it through action, North Korean state media explained Tuesday. The U.S. should stop at once arrogant provocations against the DPRK and unilateral demands and not provoke it any longer, it added. North Korea often presents the cessation of hostilities against it as the terms for de-escalation."	Fake
" Bombshell Report: DNC Hack Was an Inside Job, Not the Russians http://www.dailyinsidernews.com/government-corruption/report-dnc-hack-inside-job/ BOMBSHELL REPORT: DNC HACK WAS AN INSIDE JOB, NOT THE RUSSIANS RUSSIAN HACKING? HA! WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT STORY? America has seen an almost never ending media stream surrounding the alleged hacking of the DNC by Russia, even though they have no evidence to support this claim. As a result, numerous investigations by private and public officials are underway and have been for quite some time.  What have they found?  Nothing at all.  Professionals in the field of computer science with undeniable expertise in the art of cyber hacking have decided to do a few investigations of their own and the results are staggering. Not only is there no evidence that a hack even occurred to anyone, let alone the Russians, the only answer that is feasible is that of inside leaks.  Someone inside the DNC allegedly downloads information onto a portable device for the sole purpose of releasing it to the public.  Via IJR:  The report details at length for the first time solid evidence in the case, compiled through exhaustive interviews with forensic experts and former national security intelligence officers who are independently investigating the DNC hack.  The conclusion of the report: This was not a hack  a hack was impossible based on the evidence. This was instead an inside job by someone who directly downloaded information from the DNC servers onto a hard device and transported it, intending it to be released.  A large group of experts agree, there is no evidence to support a hack of the DNC.  There has been a long effort to counter the official narrative we now call Russiagate. This effort has so far focused on the key events noted above, leaving numerous others still to be addressed. Until recently, researchers undertaking this work faced critical shortcomings, and these are to be explained. But they have achieved significant new momentum in the past several weeks, and what they have done now yields very consequential fruit. Forensic investigators, intelligence analysts, system designers, program architects, and computer scientists of long experience and strongly credentialed are now producing evidence disproving the official version of key events last year. Their work is intricate and continues at a kinetic pace as we speak. But its certain results so far are two, simply stated, and freighted with implications:  There was no hack of the Democratic National Committees system on July 5 last yearnot by the Russians, not by anyone else. Hard science now demonstrates it was a leaka download executed locally with a memory key or a similarly portable data-storage device. In short, it was an inside job by someone with access to the DNCs system. This casts serious doubt on the initial hack, as alleged, that led to the very consequential publication of a large store of documents on WikiLeaks last summer."	Fake
" BREAKING STUDY PROVES TRUMP WAS RIGHT  EVERY CITIZEN VOTER Has Been BETRAYED! http://president45donaldtrump.com/breaking-study-proves-trump-right-every-citizen-voter-betrayed/ Results from a new study concluded that millions of non-citizens could have voted in the 2008 presidential election, suggesting that President Donald Trumps claim that more than 3 million illegal alien voters cost him the popular vote in November might be accurate. After reviewing post-election polling data, New Jersey research group Just Facts announced that the number of non-citizens voting illegally is considerably more than previous estimates, the Washington Times reported. In fact, as many as 5.7 million non-citizens may have voted in the 2008 election that gave Barack Obama his first term in the White House. Just Facts, a non-profit research and educational institute, estimated that as many as 7.9 million non-citizens illegally registered in 2008 and somewhere between 594,000 to 5.7 million actually voted in that years presidential election. So much for Democrats claim that voter fraud doesnt exist. Oddly enough, these numbers are in line with Trumps claim about what might have happened in 2016. Trump, who faced merciless ridicule for his claim that millions of illegal-alien voters cost him the nationwide popular vote last November, might have been closer to the truth that even he realized. If it turns out that Trump was right, then what we have at the heart of this study is the betrayal of every American voter. Because every vote cast illegally can nullify a vote cast by an American citizen, and dilute the entire electoral process. A system that allows it is betraying American democracy, and every voter should be furious about it. In May, Trump signed an executive order that established a commission to investigate voter fraud. The Presidential Commission on Election Integrity will review Trumps allegations as well as systemic issues that have been raised over many years in terms of the integrity of the elections. Theres no telling what the commission will find, but if it reports that our voting system is indeed as broken as these numbers suggest, then we need to know so we can begin the process of fixing it."

What Obama failed to realize is that the purpose of the US military is to be combat ready both physically and mentally. Transgenders are known to weakened by their surgery and hormone therapy as well as mentally unstable from their gender identity disorder.

There may be an enormous amount of vitriol directed at you for making this policy correction, but please know that overturning this policy may have done more in the long-term to save the culture and war-fighting capacity of the U.S. military than perhaps any other military policy you will adopt as president, the letter said.  Its just not compatible with the mission of the military, Paul E. Vallely, one of the 17 military members who signed the letter, told Breitbart News.

Now that President Trump is here we have more of a chance to undo the damage that Obama has done when he set up the refugee program that was set up to bring 100,000 Muslims into America.  From Freedom Daily:  US immigration authorities have arrested and moved to deport 199 Iraqi immigrants, mostly from the Detroit area, in the last three weeks after Iraq agreed to accept deportees as part of a deal removing it from President Donald Trumps travel ban, officials said on Wednesday.  In the Detroit area, 114 Iraqi nationals were arrested over the weekend, and 85 throughout the rest of the country over the past several weeks, Gillian Christensen, a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman, said in a statement.  The actions came as part of the Trump administrations push to increase immigration enforcement and make countries, which have resisted in the past, take back nationals ordered deported from the United States.  Trump cant win the war against the liberals and other radical groups by himself. The Americans that want a strong,independent country have to join the forces to defend the constitution.

" BREAKING: Michelle Obama SUED For Fraud http://dailypostfeed.com/michelle-obama-sued-for-fraud/  As it appears, Michelle Obama loves spending hard-earned tax dollars on lavish flights.  Michelle, we all know about your trips to Spain and Africa. There are Americans who cant afford a decent meal for their families! Yet we have this hypocrite flying around, having undeserved vacations.  Thats why Judicial Watch decided to initiate a lawsuit against Michelle. They demanded Air Force One records that will provide all necessary information about her massive vacation to Spain. The goal is to prove that Michelles trip to Spain was purely on a personal basis. If  Judicial Watch is right, then Michelle is off to spend some time in prison.  According to a Reddit sleuth:  *POTUS Compensation: $400,000 with $50,000 expense allowance, per year  *Air Force One, Boeing 747-200B, VC-25: Cost is $210,877 per hour to run and it cruises at 575 MPH.  *The flight distance between DC and Madrid is 3786.2 miles. Thats flight time of 6.5 hours and a total of $1,388,560.87, one way. The flight distance between DC and Cape Town is 7,907.7 miles. Thats a flight time of 13.75 hours and a total of $2,899,870.48, one way.  The total is head-spinning $4,288,430! That is waaay more than what Obama made during his position as a President.

" President Trump Signed An Executive Order That Prevents Illegals From Using Welfare. http://president45donaldtrump.com/0-23-0/ VIA| Illegal immigrants do NOT have the same rights as American citizens. Illegal immigrants came here illegally and than collect welfare paid for by taxpayers money because Barack Obama didnt seem to have a problem with it. President Trump doesnt agree with this and has therefore signed an executive order stating no illegal will be eligible for welfare and any currently enrolled will be removed from the country. Via USA Politics Today: President Trump signed an executive order according to which any illegal who lives on welfare will be sent home. And thats not all. America will no longer accept people who come here to live on our expense. These people will no longer be able to enter the country. The administration would be seeking to deny admission to any alien who is likely to become a public charge and develop standards for determining whether an immigrant can be deported after five years, if that person receives a certain amount of public assistance, including Food Stamps, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and Medicaid. Welfare was designed to help Americans, end of story."	Fake
" Muslim Federal Judge Rules Two Items Of Sharia Law Legal http://americanflavor.news/2017/08/02/muslim-federal-judge-rules-two-items-sharia-law-legal/ Judge Mahal al Alallaha-Smith of the 22nd District Federal Court of Appeals ruled this morning that two critical issues for Muslims in Sharia Law had to be abided by in the United States court system because of the systematic infusion clause and because the 14th Amendment guarantees them the rights guaranteed by other states. Alallaha-Smith noted that the 14th Amendment doesnt necessarily exclude foreign influence from being allowed by law, citing the Christmas Holiday as a perfect example: Christmas is a Christian holiday exclusively, yet if youre a Muslim and you want to go about your day without being bothered you cant because the laws of a city in a city in Rome take precedent over the 1st Amendment, which guarantees no state sponsored religion. A federal Chrsitmas holiday is just that. With that as precedent, understanding that a higher court may reverse it, my decision is that items one and two on the docket are allowable between family members as prescribed by Sharia Law. The items Judge Alallaha-Smith refers to are: A man who finds his Godly wife in the arms of another may beat her in a non-life-threatening manner as prescribed by the Koran. The punishment of death for laying with another man in her own bed cannot be enforced on American soil, but the woman can be beaten daily for a period of ten years. A family in need of expansion shall allow the marriage of first cousins for one generation as prescribed by the Koran. Women in those families can marry as young as 9 but wont be allowed to consummate until they hit maturity as prescribed in the Koran. Until this is fast-tracked to the Supreme Court, which can sometimes take years, Muslim women in America will be at risk."	Fake

According to white House sources, a bakers dozen of Obama operatives will be spending the foreseeable future looking at four gray walls and eating the equivalent of Michelle Obamas school lunches in prison. Breitbart announced Saturday night that the Trump administration has concluded an investigation into the Obama administrations illegal wiretapping of the Trump campaign and other conservatives. The months-long investigation revealed numerous high-level Obama officials who engaged in a massive surveillance campaign intended to sabotage Donald Trumps chances of winning the election. Details are scarce at the moment, but White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told the news organization that this goes all the way to the top and may reach Barack Obama himself. Among those arrested were three of Barack Obamas cabinet members, multiple FBI officials, and numerous others across at least four agencies. President Trump will reveal more details in the coming days, Sanders said, adding that it is important to keep details slim at the moment while we finish looking at other suspects.

Educating the next generation is vital to learn from our mistakes not repeat them. Radical Islam is very real and its time that lesson it taught in school. Via Conservative World Daily: The full panel of nine Supreme Court justices met to decide the fate of Islam taught in public schools. Under Obamas lead schools were teaching that Islam is a peaceful religion, even though all of our real life examples contradict that. Treddify reported that Judge Neil Gorsuch cast the tie-breaking vote. The 5-4 ruling was that the only part of Islam history taught in public schools will be Radical Islam and what students can do to help stop it. Judge Gorsuch wrote, The government certainly has no business being involved in religion, but this isnt a government issue or a religious issue. This is about the judicial branch interpreting the laws as they apply to the teaching of religion. We should be teaching any religions in this country besides standard Judeo-Christianity, as our founders wanted, and we certainly shouldnt be filling the children with lies about Islam being a religion of peace when they see the carnage on the news almost every day."

" Nancy Pelosi Met With Russian Ambassador, Discussed Plans To FRAME Donald Trump http://flashnewscorner.com/nancy-pelosi-met-russian-ambassador-discussed-plans-frame-donald-trump/ If youre a liberal, you believe that Donald Trump conspired with Russia to win the election. Never mind that not a single vote was changed and that he has been tough on Russia from day one, but the Left wants you to believe that he and members of his administration worked with Vladimir Putin to steal the election from historically unpopular criminal Hillary Clinton. Though Trump campaign officials met with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak to discuss important issues to the country, which is perfectly normal and expected when it is clear a candidate will win and after he was won, someone else was BUSTED meeting with the Russian ambassador: Nancy Pelosi. Trump was right when he said that Putin wanted Hillary Clinton to win the election and Fox News reports that there is audio of a meeting between the ambassador and Nancy Pelosi that proves it. Youre sure this will work? Pelosi can be heard asking Kislyak during a meeting at the Capital Grille in Washington D.C. in hushed tones.President Putin assures me that Donald Trump will be no more in November, Kislyak replies. Hillary Clinton will be the President. But Hillary Clinton is not the President. Vladimir Putin lost and America won. The audio was collected, ironically, during Barack Obamas illegal monitoring of Donald Trump and his campaign. Though our Muslim ex-President tried to bury it, it was uncovered by Attorney General Jeff Sessions as he looked into the prosecution of an unnamed former Obama administration official for leaking classified information to CNN.

" Obama Had A Remote Hacking Base In Germany  President Donald Trump promised Americans that he will solve every problem. Our country was stuck int he middle of nowhere, and Barack Obama didnt even move a finger to improve it. The former president had other things on his mind, but luckily he is no longer responsible for our country. But, he wont get away with the things he did in the past eight years. People are still talking about Obamas wiretapping scandal. The former president set up an entire network with the ultimate goal to catch a few big bugs. He wiretapped Trump Tower and pretty much every location President Trump goes to. But, President Trump wasnt the only person Obama targeted. We still dont know the exact number of Obamas victims, but its more than clear that President Trump was his main target.  Obama used the help of his staffers and several major institutions to play his little spy game. The world learned about this, and Obama was caught in one of the biggest scandals ever. Democrats came up with the worst excuse ever and said that Obama only targeted people who seemed to be dangerous during the presidential elections.  The former president is out of the Oval Of??ce, and he may face a lawsuit for his illegal actions. Guess what The wiretapping isn't the only thing that worries Obama at the moment. WikiLeaks confirmed that Obama spied on several foreign countries, including Germany.  The CIA even used the German facility of Frankfurt to set up its hacking base. WikiLeaks released documents according to which Frankfurt was the remote base for Obamas spying.  So, Obama wont get away with this that easily. He has to bear the consequences of his actions, and the clock has started ticking. We can only hope that justice will ??nd its way out. Americans will never forget the terrible things that happened under Obama. Its time for something good to happen.  What do you think about the latest information on Obamas spying?

Had it not been for the misrepresentation of a corpse for identification purposes, no crime was committed, and that crime only carries a 6-month sentence.

" Trump Threatens To Cancel Visit To Israel Because The McDonalds There Doesnt Have A Bacon Cheese Big Mac  President Donald Trump eats like a 6-foot, 240-pound petulant child  if that irritable youngster had the ability to push a button and make a lackey fetch a Coke. Hes set to embark on his first official trip overseas Friday with pit stops in Saudi Arabia, Israel, Belgium, Italy and the Vatican  something hes reportedly pouting about, huffing and puffing that the nine-day excursion is far too long. Worse yet: none of the places hes visiting have a Trump-branded hotel with workers that are duty-bound and practiced at serving him his favorite meals. Trump is a noted lover of fast food: McDonalds burgers and Kentucky fried chicken are staples. The Big Macs are great. The Quarter Pounder. Its great stuff, he said in a town hall event about his orders from McDonalds.  However, there might be trouble on the upcoming trip, as a source within the White House leaked information that the president is reluctant when it comes to visiting Israel, because hes not convinced hell like the food there. I wouldnt say hes scared, because he doesnt get scared, hes not the type. But theres an apprehensiveness about him whenever anyone from the staff mentions the fact that hes scheduled to visit the place, the source, who requested anonymity, told portal KnowMyRepublican.com. From what I understand, theyve tried to explain to him several times that he can have anything he wants custom prepared for him and then brought in especially tailored to his requests, but for some reason, he just doesnt want to hear of it. From what I could gather, the staff are puzzled by this as they didnt expect it to turn into that big of a problem.  The source continued, I recently had a talk about it with someone very close to him, and it seems that the reason why hes so reluctant to keep Israel on the list of visits is because, as you know, the president is a huge fan of fast food, and hes particularly fond of McDonalds. However, because of the cultural and religious differences, the company tailors their restaurants to accommodate the desires of the population in any given region where it conducts business. Thats why, for example, McDonalds restaurants throughout Europe look nothing like the ones we have here. The same applies to those in Israel; they are literally completely different from any other McDonalds restaurant  one could even argue that theyre unique. Their ingredients come from different sources and they also have different traditions when it comes to the types of meat they use.  Ultimately, my source tells me that the president is even threatening to cancel his visit to Israel because the McDonalds restaurants there dont have a bacon cheese Big Mac, which is a favorite of his. Hes apparently demanding the staff to make arrangements to somehow provide them for the duration of his visit. I dont need to tell you that the staff are very frustrated and worried about not being able to accomplish that. So much so, in fact, that Im also told theyve started contacting the McDonalds headquarters and begging the management to accommodate the presidents request. I am yet to learn of the outcome of that plead, but it gives you an idea of how spoiled Donald Trump really is. At the end of the day, i personally think theyll figure out a way to make it happen, because everybody knows Donald Trump is not a man you want to disappoint, the source concluded."	Satire
" Spicer: Trump Led BREXIT Successfully Because Of His Upper-Class, Eloquent English Skills  During Wednesdays press briefing, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer gave a strange response when European Commission President Jean-Claude Junker criticized President Donald Trumps comprehension of world affairs. Last week, Junker warned that more countries may leave the European Union after Trumps administration applauded Britains departure from the EU. I think the president is very well steeped in world affairs, especially Europe, NATO, all of the issues, Spicer insisted. He was a leader in the effort to call BREXIT, as you know.  Asked to comment on whether there was any connection between President Trumps position on BREXIT and the fact that the majority of Britains citizens voted for leaving the EU, Spicer argued that the British were smitten with the billionaire businessman-turned-presidents language skills, and decided to hear him out. As we all know, President Trump and citizens of the UK havent really gotten off on the right foot, so to speak. I think we all remember that, at one point, there was even a petition floating around to ban Donald Trump from entering Great Britain, Spicer reminded members of the press.  However, if you were to ask the British today how they felt about our president, I believe you would encounter very different responses, he continued. In my personal opinion, it is my belief that the British people became so smitten with the fact that Donald Trump at one point spoke upper-class, eloquent English that they realized he was an okay person. To make matters even more obvious, President Trump is, after all, of Scottish heritage on his mothers side. So, theres also that. Now, Im well aware of the fact that the English and the Scottish dont always see eye to eye despite being in the same union, but it would seem they have managed to find common ground when it comes to President Donald Trump.  Asked to elaborate further on Trumps rumored eloquent language skills, the press secretary argued that, even though Trumps language was a much-disputed point during his campaign, Donald Trump is known as an extremely hard worker and self-made billionaire. He also said, Thats why it comes as no surprise that he was able to improve his language to the point where he became a favorite of the citizens of the country in which our language first originated. And to put that in perspective, were talking here about England, which as you all know, has pretty much nothing left to show for other than its complicated language rules and extremely broad dictionary.  At the end of the day, Im not going to say that the English voted to leave the EU because Donald Trump said it would be a good idea. However, I would like to believe that deep down, they listened to him and really heard what he was saying precisely because he was speaking very nice in their language. When you compare that to the situation in which theyre debating whether or not theyre going to let him into the country, I think thats equivalent to climbing Mount Everest in a matter of minutes. It was a huge undertaking. And by the way, the fact that Mount Everests summit is just as cold as the British are towards Americans makes it all the more sweeter for him, I would imagine, Spicer concluded. "	Satire

" North Korea responds to Trump rhetoric http://thepeoplescube.com/peoples-blog/north-korea-responds-to-trump-rhetoric-t19627.html Moments after the tyrannical dictator Donald Trump incited the peaceful nation of North Korea by rattling the fire and fury saber, the people's democratic North Korean government led by the duly elected and beloved Kim Jong-Un made it known that they were stunned by the unwarranted macroaggression and vowed to respond in kind. During a tour of a people's chicken farm in Sum-dam Province earlier today, President Kim appeared visibly annoyed when a reporter read to him Donald Trump's speech before the reporter disappeared forever from the crowd. Kim collected himself with a few deep breaths, approached the microphones before him and stated, You don't frighten us, orange pig dog. Go and boil your bottom, you son of a silly person. I blow my nose at you, you so-called Trump President, you and all your silly American gub-er-mint. Encouraged by one of Dear Leader Kim's generals, the local chicken farmer shook off the uncomfortable pain from the pistol held against his ribs, and in a shaking voice and with lowered head asked aloud, Will you negotiate with the American pig dogs if they desire it? Kim stood straight and proud, looked directly into the camera and said, I have already told them I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough wiper. I fart in your general direction. Your mother was a hamster and your father smelled of elderberries. Now go away or I will taunt you a second time. MISSILE TEST The rhetoric between the two leaders has certainly increased in pace and hostility since the latest North Korean missile test. The soon-to-be impeached dictator Trump cited a recent North Korean missile test as the basis for his increasing anti-Asian and racist condemnations.  We have obtained a transcript of the conversation that took place with Kim Jong-Un and his staff at the people's missile test site just before the launch. We invite our readers to examine the transcript on their own. Kim Jong-Un: How does it how does it work? General Hoo Flung-Poo: I know not Dear Leader. Kim: Consult the Book of the People's Armaments. General Poo: People's Armaments, chapter two, verses nine through twenty one. Major Iyam-Fat: And General Poo raised the ballistic missile up on high, saying, O Dear Leader, bless this thy ballistic missile, that with it thou mayst blow thine round-eyed American enemies to tiny bits, in thy mercy. And Dear Leader did grin. And the people did feast upon the lambs and sloths, and carp and anchovies, and orangutans and breakfast cereals, and fruit-bats and large chu... General Poo: Skip a bit, Major...  Major Fat: And Dear Leader spake, saying, First shalt thou take out the People's Pin. Then shalt thou count to three, no more, no less. Three shall be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three. Four shalt thou not count, neither count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five is right out. Once the number three, being the third number, be reached, then launchest thou thy ballistic missile of Pyongyang towards Trump thy foe, who, being naughty in my sight, shall snuff it. We hired the same FBI agents and Democrat donors who previously had examined the Hillary Clinton emails for any sign of illegality, asking them to find any evidence in this transcript that could have warranted such a harsh response from Trump. If North Korea had indeed provoked Trump, our hand-picked, unbiased experts would have found such evidence. They did not. WHAT TO EXPECT With the increasing tensions between the two nations, our citizens have been unable to focus on the news that matters, such as, that Colin Kaepernick is still not employed by an NFL team because he is black. Neither have people paid the proper attention to Kylie Kardashian's Lamborghini guilt and other critical developments across the nation.  We would much rather be writing these stories, as well as promote the restoration of First Amendment rights by destroying others' First Amendment rights in our colleges. But unfortunately, until Trump agrees to resign from office and recognize Hillary Clinton as the rightful successor, we have no choice but to expose his continued warmongering and fake news from this administration."

Once run through the STD, we get the actual Schumer quote, If the president refuses to cave like a good Republican, and cuts off the low insurance rates we legislated for ourselves, every member of my staff agrees that premiums will go up for them and I will actually have to pay for my own health care as if I was one of the little people! This is outrageous! I am a senator! I am your god! The president ought to acknowledge our superior status, do as hes told, and finally begin acting like sniveling Republicans have for decades. Whatever Schumer meant to say, however, is irrelevant. Leading intellectual senators like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren all agree that if anything other than their agenda becomes law, everybody will die every 15 seconds, and that would be unconscionable. Will you join us at the Peoples Cube as we stand with our oppressed senators? Should our elected officials really have to obey the laws they lovingly impose on the rest of us? Isnt it a privilege, yea, a patriotic duty to pay for the health care of our dear elected leaders while we proudly endure doublings and quadruplings of our own health care premiums? Stand up and fight for the privileges of our betters! Stand up and resist the evil of the free market! Stand up and resist affordable health care! Stand up and resist Trump!"	Satire
" New Comprehensive Investigation Involving Trump http://thepeoplescube.com/peoples-blog/new-comprehensive-investigation-involving-trump-t19542.html Just In: Sources say Chuck Schumer will be announcing today at 12pm ET, that he will be organizing a new bi-partisain investigation committee into Donald Trump's recklessness on putting greens.  According to Chuck Schumer, the Senate investigation amounts to a credibility test for Trump  a chance to prove his willingness to answer uncomfortable questions about his golf game.  Schumer ticked off questions he hoped the committee would ask. Was this really about something else? Schumer asked. No doubt well have an opportunity to question Mr. Trump, about what happened. Was Mr. Trump in a tournament - What kind of tournament was it, a scramble? Did Mr. Trump purposely drive his golf cart onto the putting green to impede the golfers approaching - Was there collusion between Mr. Trump and the Club House? He ended his remarks with a direct challenge. I remind him, Schumer said, turning to the Majority Leader, and my Republican friends that nothing less is at stake than the American peoples faith in Donald Trumps PGA rating. This brings into question other issues like, 'Foot Wedges' and the lack of counting 'Penalty Strokes'. We must have this investigation to restore the integrity of the game."	Satire

" Size Doesn't Matter (when it comes to bullies)! https://www.thepondscum.com/single-post/2017/07/07/Size-Doesnt-Matter-when-it-comes-to-bullies The shorter side of bullies: Putin's height is approximately 5' 6'' - Napoleon's height at his autopsy was recorded at 5' 2 - Mussolini was 5' 6 - Stalin 5' 5 - Franco 5' 4 - Hitler 5' 8 - Kim Jong Un 5' 7 without  heels.    The taller side of bullies: Osama bin Laden - 6' 5 - Saddam Hussein 6' 1 - Fidel Castro 6' 3 - Idi Amin 6' 4 - Bashar al-Assad 6' 2 - while Trump waddles around at 6' 2.    Bullies seem to come in all shapes and sizes! A strong argument can be made to support the notion that Putin is the most powerful leader in the world today. There are numerous reasons why this may be true. 1.) He is perhaps the richest man in the world. 2.) He isn't afraid of being aggressive. 3.) He has an enormous nuclear arsenal to use as leverage against the world. 4.) He understands spying and cyber warfare and uses it to his full advantage. 5.) He knows that the Western nations are afraid to engage in yet another bloody confrontation. 6.) He has no clear threats to stop him from being a bully and obtaining his goals. 7.) He has the ability to thwart any opposition to his authority. 8.) Under Trump, Putin has free rein to manipulate the Unites States into making unwise policy decisions and control negative diplomatic outcomes.   Trump might stand taller than Putin but thus far he has succumbed to his power without even a struggle. Bullies can only be challenged by the truth - and not by appeasing their self interests and ignoring their wrong doing. Without the fear of retaliation bullies run wild. They come to power by exerting force on their enemies and by never having to pay the price for their crimes against humanity. By inviting Putin to the G20 party you are already giving him a seat at a table he has yet to prove that he is worthy of sitting at. It's important to have discussions with our enemies but there's no need to reward them for their vile acts. If there were more clear lines drawn in the sand and they were backed up - then maybe the Putins of the world wouldn't feel so empowered to cross them ad infinitum.   More must be done to force aggressive dictators to abide by a solid set of humanitarian rules before countries, even Western countries including the United States, buy their products and enter into trade agreements with them. Isn't it all so damn hypocritical? Gee, you kill journalists and poison political candidates but we really want your natural gas and steel? This is sending out dangerous mixed messages.   If a bully lived in your neighborhood and had done horrific things in another area but also happens to own a swimming pool and summer swings around and the kids would love to cool off - do you turn a blind eye and let the kids go over there to have some fun? Especially since all the other nice moms and dads on your block are letting their kids go - and to sweeten the deal at lunchtime the bully will be having a barbecue with free hot dogs and hamburgers and ice cream pops for dessert? People are reluctant to have principles because it's so much easier to just rationalize your own wimpy actions. Sure, the man is a bully, but why should I suffer in other ways because of something he did to other folks that doesn't affect me? It's like a father who abused his family but the family still treats him warmly so they don't get cut out of his will. Yeah - having principles is complicated and usually if you have them you lose out on something. But without them you support something abhorrent. What kind of person do you prefer to be? I suppose there are those gray ethical areas. Damn if you do and damned if you don't. Doing the right thing should be more highly valued than doing the thing that reaps you the most reward.   Countries go through the same rationalization dilemmas. Putin stole Crimea and is waging war on the Ukraine. He's also done a lot of other repugnant acts. Do we ignore his misdeeds? Punish him for his brutal actions? Or put all of the yucky stuff on the back burner and see if we can get something we want out of him? This approach, I feel is like trying to run away from a monster with leg irons on. The monster is eventually going to catch up to you and swallow you whole.   The Republicans might not like Trump but they are thrilled he is president and support his agenda. Will they lose the House and Senate in 2018 because of their acceptance of him and his help the rich get richer policies and ban everyone the haters don't like from coming to the States? Or will Americans be strong and follow their moral conscience and principles - and vote en masse to oust the bullies? Will we insist upon accountable elections? Invest in protecting our districts from hacking? Devise ways to fight back against tactics that make a mockery out of our democratic process? The clock is ticking...   Trump and Putin are living examples of what happens when two bullies, a short fit one and a tall plump one have their way. The entire world has to work together to make sure there are mechanisms put in place to prevent the climb to power of similar bullies from ever happening again."	Satire

" Ukrops Launches Rainbow Cookie Satellite To Spy On Kroger https://thepeedmont.com/2017/02/24/ukrops-launches-rainbow-cookie-satellite-to-spy-on-kroger/  RICHMOND, Va.  Senior officials at the Ukrops Flight Facility have announced plans to launch a weather satellite, model RAINBOW-4248CO, this weekend at the Bob Ukrop Space Center in Goochland County, VA.  While the satellite was described as merely meteorological, the launch has been met with outrage from Kroger, a long-standing rival of Ukrops Super Markets and Homestyle Foods. Top officials quickly responded with a statement condemning the launch and calling for an international response to Ukrops space program.  Weve seen this kind of aggressive behavior from Ukrops before, commented Kroger Bakery Defense Minister Col. William T. McPearson. Those bastards have been trying to steal our recipes for decades. Were not falling for it and we promise you, we will respond.  Tensions between the two companies have escalated in recent years after Ukrops was purchased by competitor Martins Food Markets. Both Martins and Kroger carry Ukrops line of baked goods, though this is mostly seen as a form of grocery appeasement in response to increasingly belligerent posturing by the defunct local store.  Our Rainbow Cookie satellite is purely for measuring climatic phenomena, responded Mason Detweiler, the Chief Space Commissioner for Ukrops. Were a peaceful bakery looking to study clouds, nothing more.  There is speculation among the League of Grocers that the Ukrops satellite will instead be laden with advanced surveillance technology. Listen, weve looked into sanctions, weve looked into baked intervention, commented Dr. Nancy Fitzgerald, acting Chairwoman of the Ukrops watchdog group BakeWatch. At the end of the day, Ukrops is a sovereign company that bakes delicious, fluffy rolls, but if they violate the Cakes & Cookies Agreement of 82 well be watching and well take action.  Many see the launch as a last-ditch attempt at glory for a once super market. Many in the baking community are hoping for a speedy de-escalation of the Ukrops/Kroger tensions. Weve lost a lot of good cakes over the years, added Col. McPearson, Were ready for peace. But were also ready for war."	Satire

" New Monument Avenue Snapchat Filter Makes You Robert E. Lee https://thepeedmont.com/2017/09/06/new-monument-avenue-snapchat-filter-makes-you-robert-e-lee/  RICHMOND, Va.  The League of the South, a neo-Confederate group, has commissioned a series of Snapchat filters in an attempt to connect with potential Millennial and Generation Z converts. These location-specific imaging filters, or geofilters, can be used at well-known Confederate landmarks throughout the South.  One of the most popular filters can be found at Richmonds own Robert E. Lee statue on Monument Avenue. Here visitors can be turned into General Lee and placed in front of a Confederate flag background. In addition to the full beard and dandy comb-over, the filter also provides a voice-changer, altering the users voice to a deep southern drawl with just a tinge of genteel racism.  Snapchat produces imaging filters that can accommodate more than one individual, often applying a different effect to the less prominent face in the photo. In the case of the Robert E. Lee filter, the secondary subject dons a virtual Confederate infantry uniform, complete with a layer of lice bites and dysentery-induced sweating.  Adolf McCreary, a member of the League of the South, traveled all the way from Winchester to take a picture in front of the infamous statue.  Those libtard pussies are denying their southern heritage. Were giving everyone the chance to feel like a true American hero, McCreary explained. The South with rise again. Virtually, that is.  City spokesperson Laura Smithson released a statement regarding the controversial Snapchat filter: The City of Richmond wants it clear that it does not condone the use of these divisive Snapchat filters. Richmond is committed to keeping an environment that is welcoming and safe for people of all races and creeds. We absolutely do not support any attempt to divide or alienate the people of this great city.  In response to the news that there has been an increase in the number of alt-right individuals having their asses kicked as a result of using the Lee Snapchat filter, Smithson responded in a monotone, Oh no. Gosh, thats terrible. Geez. Stop. Please. No.  In an attempt to draw attention away from the League of the Souths social media ploy, the City of Richmond has decided to release its own youth-appealing Snapchat filters. A few blocks down from the Lee statue at the intersection of Monument Avenue and Roseneath Road, Snapchat users can superimpose their face on the animated, tennis racket-swinging body of Arthur Ashe surrounded by a crowd of cowering Bitmoji children."

I cannot tell you how many times in my youth I had my back to the wall, wondering where my next big break would come from and got pulled out of the fire by a scratcher, Kaine explained. If we lose, we only lose two bucks, but if we win, oh boy, then we win big, the senator concluded as he clutched the sides of the podium with white knuckles.  He went on to assure the Senate body that his plan represented a far less risky strategy than the other proposed resolutions and stated that investing and stuff is hard and confusing.    As they argued against the resolution, many senators pointed out that they had recently noticed an abundance of crumpled scratchers cluttering Kaines desk in the Senate Chamber.

Devos writes, Look: When women were barred from attending college 40 years ago, no female students were raped, because there were no female college students. Thus, educating women is dangerous. The numbers clearly show that female college students are at fault. If we're going to stop campus rape, the key is returning to all-male campuses. Thats just science!  Devos points to Stanford University rapist Brock Turner, insisting that the young swimmer would never have had the opportunity to rape a female classmate if he had no female classmates, saying coeducation must be abolished. Her essay triumphantly concludes with a bar graph illustrating a severe uptick in campus rapes between 1200 B.C. and 2017.  In a footnote, DeVos explains that 1200 B.C. was a golden time when men protected women from campus rape via laws that criminalized female literacy.  The bar graph is constructed of skittles and glue. Devos, who is trying to get her blame the valedictorian theory of campus rape published in a peer-reviewed journal, says she is facing blowback. Editors at Scientific American rejected her article submission for being written in crayon. Meanwhile, Know Your IX's Alexandra Brodsky criticized Devos's analysis as horrifying. Simply horrifying."

From now on, thanks to the Lochte Rule, the State Department can revoke the passport of any U.S. citizen who sullies America's reputation while voyaging overseas, including tourists who berate French waiters to speak American, injure the French President while trying to shake his hand, kill Cecil the lion, or falsely claim to be the victim of a crime while representing the U.S. Swim Team at the Rio Olympics. Americans who climb sacred ruins while attempting to take selfies will likewise be banned. Going forward, TSA agents will get training to screen American tourists who are boarding international flights for signs of potential rudeness, including sleeveless t-shirts, open-toe sandals, and Make America Great Again hats. TSA agents will be empowered to confiscate fanny packs and immediately consign them to airport trash.  The State Department is also starting Good World Manners, a program that's designed to help tourists who fall afoul of Clinton's travel ban stop bringing shame on their nation. The programs addresses hard questions like: Are museums places for my outside voice?, Should I eat at McDonalds when in Rome?, Is it appropriate to chant 'U-S-A!

The outburst reportedly followed an upsetting conversation Sessions was having with some of his younger Republican peers about popular TV shows and Hawaii, the birthplace of former President Barack Obama.

While critics like Jon Lovett pounced on Bannon's comment, calling it obviously anti-Semetic, in follow up interviews, Bannon denied charges of anti-Semitism, saying: Look, I am not joking about the Holocaust. I am literally saying that Spicer would have perished in the Holocaust despite his blonde hair and blue eyes because he's a fat faggot and Hitler had good taste.  Despite moving to Hollywood, Spicer has struggled to find work since his former boss, failed GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, lost the election to President Hillary Rodham Clinton in November by 3 million votes. In a heartfelt email, Spicer pointed out that he's auditioned to play a zombie extra on the AMC's hit show The Walking Dead several times, so far without success. In a press release responding to Bannon's horrifying comments, Spicer profusely apologized. I am so sorry I've offended Bannon by being too Jewish. As a man of exclusively Irish-American descent, I don't know how to address my latent Jewish inferiority, but I will work tirelessly to change myself racially if it means getting back on television, he said.

" Fact checkers unionize under Clinton administration http://www.hillarybeattrump.org/home/2017/3/23/fact-checkers-unionize-under-clinton-administration WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Fact checkers thrived during last year's campaign season, with many candidates spewing lies at consistently high rates. Under the reality-based President Hillary Clinton, however, fact checkers have found themselves with nothing to do. Facing pay cuts and mass layoffs, they recently decided to unionize. The American Fact Checkers Association (AFCA) held its first press conference on Thursday afternoon. Representing fact checkers from MSNBC, CNN, Politico, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and Fox News -- along with the entire staff of Politifact -- the union demands that media organizations allow journalists to continue reporting on failed presidential candidate Donald Trump.  So what if Trump's not president? questioned Tom Potter, a fact checker at Politico who worries about imminent termination. He still tweets false information all the time! Someone needs to report on his Twitter feed! Media outlets united to publish a collective response. In a statement released halfway through the union's press conference, they argue that fact-checking is a dying profession, but that they will allow a small number of promising fact checkers to transition to other positions within the industry. We cannot keep reporting on a dishonest, failed presidential candidate just to keep our fact checkers employed, explained Martin Baron, Editor of The Washington Post. That would do a disservice to our readers, who are quite frankly sick of reading about Donald Trump.  Meanwhile, editors of right wing propaganda sources like Breitbart News, The Daily Caller, and The Washington Free Beacon announced they would be happy to hire fact checkers for the current administration. Frustrated at their candidate's landslide loss, their reporters continue to deny climate change, misinterpret the Second Amendment, and lie about the effects of vaccines."	Satire
" Maine Becomes the First State to Legalize Ecstasy http://empirenews.net/maine-becomes-the-first-state-to-legalize-ecstasy/ Maine has been in the news all year for legalizing marijuana for recreational use, and apparently legalizing weed was only the beginning. Following on the heels of the wave of marijuana legalization, some might be surprised to hear that Maine state legislature has decided to legalize the popular street drug Ecstasy. Recreational use of will become fully legal in the state by the end of this year.  The decision was met with controversy but no more or less than the original decision to legalize marijuana, Governor Paul LePage stated.  The state is still working out some guidelines and ground rules for suppliers, such as purity levels, permits, and health code requirements. While LePage says the vote was popular among a lot of people in the state, his decision came as a shock for many Mainers. Governor LePage did not comment on whether or not he partakes in the drug himself.  By legalizing, monitoring, and taxing ecstasy, we will not only cut down on inmates and care costs, it will also open up a whole new job market, LePage explains. Its a good situation all around, especially for taxpayers.Some of the most outspoken opponents, however, have been current drug dealers.  Making it legal is a terrible idea, a dealer, who chose to remain anonymous, told Empire News. We dont want regulated. Were killing it stacking paper right now, but regular guys like me wont be able to keep up with all the government regulations. This is gonna put me out of a job!  Despite the negative press, experts estimate this legalization will drop the states debt by as much as 50% in the first year. This may translate into tax cuts, more public projects, better road maintenance, and possibly even government rehabilitation programs for more dangerous drugs like cigarettes.  If they want people to not buy drugs legally, then for crying out loud they should shut down every Starbucks in the United States,said LePage. Marijuana, ecstasy, crackhell, whats the difference? The revenue the state will bring in, its astronomical. Health is one thing, but were talking about money here."	Satire

The Statue of Liberty has been seated on Liberty Island in the middle of New York Harbor since October 28, 1886.  The New York historical Museum has already vowed to occupy the area around the historic site for a sit in type protest where they will handcuff one another to form a complete circle around the base of the statue.  They cannot tear it down if we form an unbreakable human barrier, said Jos Ramirez, president of the Immigrant Resource Center of New York. As Patrick Henry said, Give me liberty, or give me death!

White House physician, Dr. Mark Campbell, now reports that Donald Trump has lost nearly 50% of his vision in one eye. President Trump was warned that staring at the sun could cause serious damage, but he assumed it was fake news, said Dr. Campbell. Since the eclipse, Trumps vision has become worse and worse, with a noticeable deterioration of his retina. There is no reversing it.  Dr. Campbell went on to say that Trumps left eye experienced some damage as well, but that the right eye sustained the brunt of the damage."	Satire

I already dodged the draft, made my way through life without ever having to serve in the military, so there was no way I was going to ever have to deal with possibly engaging in real combat, said President Trump. It worked out that I was planning on becoming a woman, as Ive known for some time that I was not comfortable as a man. I mean, Im not a faggy peter-puffer or anything. I still love grabbing women by the pussy. I just like to tuck it back and throw on a nice dress. When he was informed that he is well past the age of being drafted in the likely case that he leads the country into war, Trump was noticeably embarrassed.  Nobody tells me anything about how this stuff actually works, said our Commander-in-Chief. Either way, I cannot wait for everyone to meet the new Donald. I think Im going to go with the name Donna."

" Nuclear option baby-proofed to prevent President Dump Truck from blowing us all up! http://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/128796/nuclear-option-baby-proofed-to-prevent-president-dump-truck-from-blowing-us-all-up After the president Unpresidentially resorted to rhetoric usually ascribed to lunatic dictators in response to North Korea's typical give me money antics, the Joint Chiefs of Staff decided that preventative measures needed to be taken. Newly minted Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis wasted no time corralling the often unbridled Commander in Chief. Since, the President is unaccustomed to the fine art of diplomacy we have taken the necessary steps to make sure he doesn't accidentally write a check that America's butt doesn't really want to cash. The Secretary was believed to be referring to the new White House policy of hiding the nuclear codes inside a book. The thought being, there is a 0% the president will ever open a book, even if he feels like nuking somebody. General Joe Dunford explained, We originally were going to hide it in the President's own Bible, but then we realized he might start waving it around when his conservative base starts to figure out the last time the President was in church he was in diapers, and we don't mean depends. It was determined that the safest book to hide it in was War and Peace, because, it was big enough that there was no chance Trump would risk picking it up to show how tiny his fingers are, much less consider reading the thing. Deputy Secretary of Defense, Pat Shanahan explained that they also took measures to remove all markers from the Oval Office to prevent the president from writing the codes on his hand. It was a bit of a habit he was getting into, the Deputy Secretary explained. It usually worked itself out, since he wipes his mouth with his hands after lunch, and the grease from the fried chicken usually smeared a few of the characters so he couldn't read it. Our concern then became, what if he requested the codes during one of his 3:00 a.m. tweet storms, and decided to fire off a few weapons before breakfast? The nuclear suitcase that is always at the president's disposal was also addressed. We just put baby locks on it, Mattis explained. Through direct experience with the President we have observed that if anything takes him more than two minutes to figure out he usually loses interest in. It's kind of like dealing with an orangutan. Secretary Mattis reaffirmed his confidence that there was no way that Trump could figure out baby locks within that narrow of a time frame, even with his baby-sized fingers. Listen, the President has the same freedom of speech as every other American, so he can talk all the fire and whatever the hell else he wants. We just want to make sure that when he sounds off like a total tool bag he doesn't accidentally start World War 3."	Satire

The problem was not in reigniting the American strive to achieve planetary travel or even Trumps inability to understand Buzz Aldrins Toy Story quite during his speech. The concern many found was that the president seemed to misunderstand what exactly space was. At some point in the future, were going to look back and say how did we do it without space? Trump asked, as if space was one of the scientists on the team. Aldrins response was obvious and caught on camera. Needless to say, the gaffe once again lit up the social media and internet, causing a plethora of comments mocking the presidents inability to hold his own even when it comes to reading a pre-prepared speech. In reaction to the mockery, President Trump lashed out against Aldrin, who made history as being the second man to set foot on the Moon, right after Neil Armstrong. Speaking with portal KnowMyRepublican.com, he said that its a shame people are still having trouble understanding how far fake news go and how long theyve been around. He added, They say Im ridiculous, but at least I understand whats going on in this country, unlike some people. The president continued, I had no intention of bringing this up today, but this whole fake news business is really turning into a global conspiracy thats threatening to set back every single positive thing Ive done for this country so far. Let me tell you, at first, I was alright with it  as much as one can be alright with something like that  because they were going after me and Im the president and thats okay. But its only recently that Ive begun to comprehend the full extent of the lies some people are ready to believe in this country. Ill also say that, for the greatest country in the world, some of our citizens are pretty gullible. This whole landing on the Moon business is a good example. No way did that happen, especially not back then. If you actually believe we had the technology and resources to send two men to land on the Moon in the 1960s, then you really ought to go and get your head checked out, Trump added. It was all fake news, even back then. As a matter of fact, one could say thats how fake news started in the first place, because the government back then needed something grand to make sure people would continue believing the top political establishment, so they made up the story that these two guys went and walked on the Moon. Let me tell you, if I was the head of NASA, especially back then, theres a billion other people Id rather choose for the mission over this Aldrin guy. Hes not a winner, hes nothing. Its ridiculous. I mean, he trains all his life to become an astronaut, gets chosen for the epic, historical mission, somehow manages to get up there successfully and then doesnt have the brass to go out in front of Armstrong and cement his place in history as being the first guy to set foot on the Moon? I mean, come on, thats idiotic. Every single one of us would have jumped at the chance to do something that monumental and important. And youre trying to tell me that, not only was he up there, but that he also had the decency and good manners to let someone else go down in history as number 1? Youre telling me he was up there and still willingly agreed to be number 2? And Im supposed to respect and take insults from that guy, from the number 2? Come on, be serious. Theres no way Im putting up with that liar. There was no evidence whatsoever that he came close to the Moon, let alone walked on it, Trump concluded./politicot.com"	Satire
" Ryan Bans Women From Appearing Sleeveless In House Of Reps: Strippers Are Not Welcome Anymore, We Were Elected To Make America God-Fearing Again http://uspoln.com/2017/07/08/ryan-bans-women-appearing-sleeveless-house-reps-strippers-not-welcome-anymore-elected-make-america-god-fearing/ Based on the whims of House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI), women attempting to enter the speakers lobby have been denied entrance based on their shoulder-baring sleeveless shirts and dresses. According to CBS News, multiple female journalists have reported that theyve been turned away from the speakers lobby due to their bare shoulders  a policy not shared by either the Senate or the White House. The new dress code appears to first have been enforced in May, when, according to the report, Independent Journal Reviews Haley Byrd was kicked out of the lobby for violating the rule. The CBS report details the experiences of another young reporter who was told she couldnt enter the lobby because of her dress. She improvised by tearing pages from her notebook to create sleeves  but was still turned away. Commenting on the ban in question  which was not made known to those frequenting the speakers lobby in any way  Ryan said in an interview with portal KnowMyRepublican.com that there are some lines that must never be crossed, as well as that the minute we start allowing liberal attire to be worn in places designated for strict political affairs, we will have lost the battle for this countrys wellbeing. Many people criticize not only President Donald Trump, but the Republican Party as well in general, he said. That means they cannot tell the difference between people who became Republicans for personal gain and those that did the same so they could change this country for the better. Now, change is something thats difficult and not always pleasant; President Trump made it known that he wants to make America great again, but what he forgot to mention was, in order for that to happen, we must first make it God-fearing again. Ryan continued, That is why we were elected, this is the first, the most important and also the most difficult task that lies ahead. Why? Because a country is not comprised of its cities, or weapons, or buildings and inanimate objects. A country is its people. And if one wants to change a country for the better, they must start by changing the people  their habits, culture, behavior, you name it. Therefore, it stands to reason that, in order to make this country God-fearing again, one needs to remove all temptations that may lead the population to sin. I think everyone agrees that the number one sin that plagues our nation is the sin of lust and sex. Women who dress up as strippers and come to work showing their body parts are not only a distraction to the men they work with  they are also a potential reason for men to stop doing their jobs and start fantasizing about their female co-workers. So, again  remove the source of temptation and youll have solved the problem. That is why women who dress up as strippers, as well as anyone who may support what they stand for, are no longer welcome in the House of Representatives as of recently. Moreover, it has been decided that the House of Representatives will serve as an experiment to determine what sort of effect such a ban will have on the productivity and general behavior of those who work here. If the experiment proves to be a success  which I have absolutely no doubt it will  it will be expanded to other institutions in this country. And before anyone starts pulling the gender equality card, let me just point out that the ban also extends to men who frequent the area, as they are required to wear a suit and tie at all times while here. This is just a small step on the way to changing this country for the better, and restoring it to its traditional, God-fearing values. And on a more personal note, this sort of thing makes me proud to be an American, Ryan concluded./politicot.com/"	Satire

Apparently, this isnt the way CNN sees it. CNNs Jim Acosta continues to attack President Trump every chance he gets. Most of the time it results in Fake News. Today was no different! Earlier this morning Jim Acosta sent out a Tweet, directed at President Trump. In that Tweet, he accused the President of finally holding a press conference overseas. He ignored the fact that this only President Trumps second trip abroad. Then he starts his typical whining about being called fake news. Everyone knows about Jim Acostas showboating and his attacks on the President. Do you remember the time he was rude and interrupted Donald Trump? Who can forget, right!?! Donald Trump made it clear back then that he thinks CNN is fake news. The attacks from this CNN Reporter havent stopped. After Jim Acostas inflammatory Tweet this morning, he took it a step further. He implied that President Trump was holding a fake news conference because CNN was not given an opportunity to ask a question. It only took a few minutes for the Internet to catch on fire. Conservatives and Liberals both fired back at Jim Acosta. The most notable response was from Donald Trump Jr. He pointed out a very important fact. If Jim Acosta thinks it is fake news when the President wont take questions from CNN, does that mean every press conference held by Obama was fake? It looks like Don Jr. is fed up. After Acostas dishonest attack on the President, he ratcheted up his own Twitter heat! He Tweeted several more times about CNN. Finally, before Jim Acosta the CNN reporter made himself the news today, Donald Trump Jr. retweeted a valid question for CNN. So far, CNN has failed to answer the question from Charlie Kirk!"	Satire

Michelle Bachmann spoke with Breitbart News about the protests outside of a Donald Trump campaign stop in Minneapolis, claiming that the protesters acted violently toward Trump supporters. Bachmann argued that President Obama has sanctioned violence, as long it protects the people favorable to the Obama position, politically. She insisted that the president is sending a signal to Donald Trump supporters: Dont attend Donald Trump events because you could be physically assaulted. She also linked the Obama administrations lawlessness to the incident in Minneapolis, claiming that Obama has effectively condoned violence against conservatives and white people, leaving normal people helpless in the face of anarchy. And these days it has become so obvious that Im honestly surprised were not having riots throughout the country, she said. When did this become a nation of criminals? I didnt get that memo. And if you look at it, if you just take a look at how many white people and conservative people have suffered because of violence in the past 8 years alone, it will become very clear that this is something only a highly powerful apparatus is capable of organizing. You know, the kind of apparatus we like to call the Obama administration. Im not sure what other Americans are thinking, but as for me, I feel like the last 8 years were the absolute worst time to be white in America. The ex-Rep. then argued that not even slaves suffered as much as white people are being targeted nowadays. Its true, once it was also terribly inconvenient to be black in this country. And yes, African-Americans have suffered greatly at the hand of white people, Im not going to try to deny that. But one thing must be very clear  were supposed to be all evolved right now, were supposed to have learned from our mistakes. That means that there should be no more racial tensions in America at all. And yet, what is our president doing? Hes protecting those who want to hurt white people, as youve seen in Minneapolis. In fact, Bachmann continued firing, I dont think all of the suffering of African-Americans during the period of slavery can ever equate to whats been done to white conservative Americans in the past 8 years of Obamas presidency. She added, Because, lets face it, during that time, weve had the Supreme Courts decision to legalize same-sex marriage, weve had countless terrorist attacks, weve had many racial killings and crimes and weve had several small-scale revolutions in some of Americas major cities. Is that the legacy President Obama wants to be remembered by? Does he really want to go down in history as the man who created a gap between black people and white people? Judging by his actions during his presidency, Im guessing he does. And lets get one thing straight  Im not just saying this because I happen to be white. No, even if I were Asian or Hindu or Martian, whatever, Id be saying the same thing all over again, Bachmann quipped. Thats what Im trying to point out  white people in America have gone through so much in the last 8 years as a race that Im seriously worried whether or not well still be around come 2025. Because, at the rate were going, all we need is another black president four years from now and well be done, just like that. Muslims are coming in on one side, foreigners from the other, a black president on yet another  white people today have been reduced to something even worse off than slaves. And thats just one step away from extinction, Bachmann concluded./politicot.com "	Satire

The county, which has voted Republican since it went for a fourth term for Franklin Roosevelt in 1944, is deep in western North Carolina in NASCAR and bluegrass territory, and many of its residents find the message to be contrary to the Christian values that are the bedrock of the small town communities within the county. President Trump won Catawba County 66.8 percent to Hillary Clintons 29.3 percent, so it might have been expected that the residents would support his travel ban, but their staunch religious beliefs appear to override any concern about the dangers posed by unvetted immigration. The North Carolina Pastors Network is noted on the billboard as the sponsor and stands by the message despite some residents finding it offensive and even unchristian. Residents of nearby Claremont and Catawba are talking about the sign on Interstate 40 that traverses the state from the Raleigh-Durham area through Winston-Salem and west to Knoxville, Tennessee. Oliver Reitzell opposes the billboard on religious grounds. I believe in the Christian way, and thats to embrace everybody. Kind of the hate message behind it, Im not for that. An associate pastor at the Corinth Reformed Church in the town of Hickory goes a step further and says the billboard actually contradicts Biblical teaching and sees the presence of non-Christians as an opportunity to preach the gospel to them. My opinion is that I think these people need the saving gospel of Jesus more than I need to be protected, Cummings said But Paul Cummings. Im perfectly willing for people who are hostile to us to be in our country, because thats what loving your enemy is all about. Evangelist Dave Kistler, who heads up the North Carolina Pastors Network disagrees and says there is nothing hateful in the message on the billboard. Some have interpreted it to be that and say that.

The fiscal year that has the economy improving and jobs being created is still the budget agreed upon by President Obama and the former Congress.  October will be Trumps first fiscal year.  This means the budget that he and Congress approve will be in effect.  While some benefits from 8-years of Obamas policies will still be seen, the immediate deals and spending will all be GOP-approved since they hold the majority in Congress and Trump claims to be a Republican.  In 2016, Trump said that Mexico would pay for a border wall to separate the US border as if Mexicans were invading Mongolians to the Chinese mainland.  Mexico has insisted it will not pay for the wall and experts have made it clear that the wall would be able to stop all avenues of immigration to America. Cutting $1 billion dollars that Americans have paid to ensure the victims of Hurrican Harvey and future natural disasters can get relief is beyond criminal.  The city of Houston will need to be rebuilt.  Cutting a billion dollars of aide away for America so Trump can keep a campaign promise that would never come true should be considered a slap in the face of every tax-paying American citizen.  Beware and tell your friends.  Congress is willing to cut $1 billion dollars in the aftermath to Hurricane Harvey because Trump is threatening to shut government down, which will make them look bad right before a Congressional election year.

According to the ships manifest, there are only four people still unaccounted for, said lead investigator Garret Muckley. It looks like every member of Weezer went down with the vessel. I just hope to the good Lord above they played El Scorcho before they went under.  Lifeboat protocol calls for women and children to be evacuated first, but organizers were quick to point out that neither women nor children were onboard during the disaster."	Satire
" How to Use the Secret Menu at Chipotle to Order a Gun http://thehardtimes.net/hardstyle/use-secret-menu-chipotle-order-gun/ One of the best things about Chipotle is the secret menu. Using this hidden set of selections, customers can treat themselves to crazy food combos like the Quesarito or Taco Nachos. But what you might not know is that Chipotles secret menu isnt limited to food. Heres how you can use that same secret menu to order a gun.  First off, you have to be 21. This is America and we have laws about going into a burrito place and walking out with a gun. Safety first. Second, and this is important, dont just come out and say to the person taking your order that you want to get a gun. Announcing your intentions isnt a dealbreaker but its bad manners and could lead to bad service and a subpar weapon. Third, the sequence is super important. Start off by saying you want a Veggie-Select Burrito Bowl. This is an important verbal cue to the Chipotle employee that youre down with the secret menu. Dont expect any kind of recognition or wink though. Theyre gonna play it cool just like you.  Once youve set yourself up, order your ingredients in the following order;  white rice, firing pin, firing pin spring, spring guide, sear spring, extractor spring, half black beans,  half refried beans, firing pin retainer, sear assembly, load chamber indicator, trigger disconnect, sofritas, mild salsa, disassembly button, recoil spring, dissembly button spring, magazine release spring, extractor, cam, cam pin, light cheese, grip screw, grip, rear sign assembly, sour cream, safety lever, guacamole (the gauc is going to cost extra but it is totally worth it IMO), safety spring, spacer, side of hot sauce, magazine and a side of chips.  If you ordered correctly, you should see the Chipotle employee write Gun on the tin lid for your burrito bowl. Theyll probably double bag it too because its gonna be heavy.  As far as price, the gun parts usually cost the same wherever but market gauc prices can fluctuate so expect this secret menu item to cost somewhere between $50-$55.  When you get home youre gonna have to spend some time cleaning all the food ingredients off of your gun parts. And then some more time assembling the weapon. There are tons of great guides on YouTube about how to get guacamole out of disassembly button spring, these videos are an invaluable resource.  And thats it! Simple and easy. A word of caution, though. It can be nearly impossible to tell what kind of gun youre going to get. I once ended up with a musket. So, if you have a specific gun-related need, youre probably better off going to a licensed firearms dealer and not a fast food burrito restaurant."	Satire
" David Bowie Emerges From Grave, Ending His Celebrity Who Died in 2016 Character http://thehardtimes.net/news/david-bowie-emerges-grave-ending-celebrity-died-2016-character/ LONDON  David Bowie stunned millions of fans yesterday, emerging from the tomb in seemingly peak physical condition and ending his Celebrity Who Died in 2016 character.  While many were shocked and thrilled by the iconic rock legend rising from the crypt, music critic and self-proclaimed Bowie expert Guile Westinson noted he anticipated the resurrection. If this move surprises you, you dont know the first thing about Bowie, said Westinson. As soon as I heard he had liver cancer, I said to myself, This man is a genius. Im just a little disappointed this character never actually released any music. Despite its massive popularity, Celebrity Who Died in 2016 marks the shortest tenure of any Bowie character to date  a fact Westinson attributed to the ever-increasing speed of pop culture.  Bowies always known when a character has run its course. He killed off Ziggy Stardust just in time, and he knew dying in 2016 wont be relevant by 2018, so hes moving on, Westinson added. I cant wait to see what he comes up with next.  Longtime collaborator Tony Visconti offered some insight as to what inspired Bowie to die in the first place."	Satire

" The Biblical Case for Making Trump King http://www.landoverbaptist.net/index.php/2017/09/17/the-biblical-case-for-making-trump-king/ This may be a bit controversial, but Ive been looking into the Christian monarchist movement recently, and Im starting to think we can make a compelling case from Scripture as to why we should have a King. And Im not talking about the US joining the British Commonwealth (Deuteronomy 17:15) or becoming a constitutional monarchy, but an absolute monarchy.  A representative republic is not Biblical In fact, it is never mentioned in the Bible. There was a time when Gods people had no King, but the anarchy under the judges was not a good thing.  Judges 21:25 In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.  And democratically electing leaders may not be the best way to go. Shouldnt we let God choose our leader?  Hosea 8:4 They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.  The Bible commands us to honor the King Which is difficult to do if you dont have one.  Ecclesiastes 8:2 I counsel thee to keep the kings commandment, and that in regard of the oath of God. Ecclesiastes 8:3 Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him. Ecclesiastes 8:4 Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou? Ecclesiastes 8:5 Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise mans heart discerneth both time and judgment.  Proverbs 24:21 My son, fear thou the Lord and the king: and meddle not with them that are given to change: Proverbs 24:22 For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both?  First Peter 2:13 Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lords sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme; First Peter 2:14 Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well. First Peter 2:15 For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men: First Peter 2:16 As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God. First Peter 2:17 Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.  The advantages of a monarchy Kings are always right.  Proverbs 16:10 A divine sentence is in the lips of the king: his mouth transgresseth not in judgment.  Proverbs 8:15 By [wisdom] kings reign, and princes decree justice.  But even if they arent, we should still obey them. We could look at how David refused to harm Saul even when he was trying to kill him.  First Samuel 24:6 And he said unto his men, The Lord forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the Lords anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the Lord.  Or we could look at how Jesus told the Jews to obey the Roman Emperor.  Mark 12:17 And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesars, and to God the things that are Gods. And they marvelled at him.  We could also look at the books of Samuel. Theyre a bit confusing to read. Its almost as if Samuel couldnt make up his mind whether having a King was a good idea or a bad one. For example, heres one passage that makes it sound as if Gods people had rejected Him by wanting a King to rule over them instead of a prophet.  First Samuel 8:6 But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the Lord. First Samuel 8:7 And the Lord said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.  But then as we read on, we see how having a King enabled Gods people to unite and defeat their enemies. The country seems to be divided at the moment and it has so many enemies  North Korea, Mexicans, Muslims.   Could Trump be another King David and deliver Gods people from their enemies? Having a King would also help us to set up a Theocracy. The King is required to write a copy of Gods law for himself and read it every day (Deuteronomy 17:18-20). A good King could be a religious reformer like Josiah (Second Chronicles 34:1-35:27).  How can monarchies be bad if Jesus is a King? Were soon going to be living under one when Jesus comes back, if you accept a literal reading of the Bible. He will rule as King on earth from Jerusalem for 1,000 years and then for ever on the New Earth from the New Jerusalem.  Matthew 25:31 When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory.  Psalm 48:2 Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.  Micah 4:7 And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far off a strong nation: and the Lord shall reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth, even for ever.  Revelation 19:11 And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war. Revelation 19:12 His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself . . . Revelation 19:15 And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. Revelation 19:16 And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, King Of Kings, And Lord Of Lords.  Revelation 20:4 And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.  Hebrews 1:8 But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.  Can we really come up with a better system of government than God?  Do we now have a suitable candidate?   Ok, so Trump has had three wives. Thats nothing compared to Solomon (First Kings 11:3)  I think it would be nice if we could lock in Trump. I dont want to think about getting stuck with a Democrat if they one day actually suspend democratic elections, like they always secretly want to do.  So, what do you think?"	Satire
" Despite the Constant Negative Press Covfefe  the True Meaning! http://www.landoverbaptist.net/index.php/2017/06/02/despite-the-constant-negative-press-covfefe-the-true-meaning/ Glory to Jesus! President Trump has once again approached the sinners with a tremendous message. Praise God! Its the now famous covfefe message that fools (Proverbs 10:21) fail to understand. President Trump, as always, knows what He is doing. The explanations by the biased liberal press are revealing but useless.  Quote: Its a good guess that the word he was looking for was coverage. But the tweet, and the thought, remained incomplete. Within two hours, it had been retweeted more than 60,000 times and liked more than 74,000 times  making it one of his most popular tweets in months. Our True Christian Department of Biblical Linguistics at the Landover Baptist University (Lamentations Flint Memorial Building) do acknowledge that the sentence would make secular sense with the word coverage as follows: Despite the constant negative press coverage. But that is old alternative news. President Trump has moved beyond the mortal realm of mundane worries. We were certain that the message would contain a Biblical message and after careful scrutiny we are happy to announce that is does!  Covfefe -> cov fe fe -> parts of words -> three words involved -> its time to look at the King James Bible! Cov -> Covenant!  Hebrews 8:6 But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant , which was established upon better promises.  The Covenant between God and His True Christian flock, but also a better Covenant, the Covenant of President Trump with His chosen people, again, us True Christians! Glory.  Fe -> Life!  Matthew 25:46 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.  The Covenant is here. The negative press shall go away into everlasting punishment but the righteous True Christians (i.e., us) into Life Eternal. Glory.  Fe -> Female!  Genesis 1:27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.  The Covenant gives us Life Eternal if we follow the Creation Doctrine of God and refrain from gender confusion and sodomy! Now the message of President Trump can be translated to the masses. Despite the Constant Negative Press Covfefe  -> Despite the Constant Negative Press, the Covenant Remains and is Stronger because of My Ministry (i.e., Presidency). It will take you True Christians into Life Eternal if you follow the God-given roles of Male and Female. A staggering message from a Terrific President directed at us. Let us all join in a Prayer of Thanks!  Thank you, Jesus for giving us President Trump!  Yours in Christ,  Elmer"	Satire
" Easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man? The Case of Donald Trump http://www.landoverbaptist.net/index.php/2017/03/26/easier-for-a-camel-to-go-through-the-eye-of-a-needle-than-for-a-rich-man-the-case-of-donald-trump/ Jesus felt He needed to post the following verse on two separate Gospels so it must be True:  Mark 10:25 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.  Luke 18:25 For it is easier for a camel to go through a needles eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.  It is True and it is being abused in a disgusting manner by atheist secularist of the sodomite agenda to accuse our President Trump for acting in an un-Christian manner. Just because He is rich!    As True Christians it is our task to defend the Godliest President ever, Mr. Donald Trump, from this contemptuous and erroneous slander. The ridiculous claim of these false Christians is that as President Trump is rich, He cannot get into Heaven. However, the apparent contradiction is not contradictory at all when we look at the alternative explanations provided by the best available evidence in order of importance:  1. The Bible. 2. Powerful personal Testimonials. 3. Observational data (photographs, research data, etc.). Is the verse about camels and needles a True one? Of course it is. However, there is the question of translations. An ancient translation into the Syriack or Aramaic (Daniel 2:4) tongue called the Peshitta (Luke 18:25         ) may offer an explanation.  Quote: Peshitta translation [which] has the word rope in the main text but a footnote on Matthew 19:24 which states that the Aramaic word gamla means rope and camel, possibly because the ropes were made from camel hair. This would mean that it is actually a rope that should be but through the eye of a needle, which is at first glance much easier than it is to accomplish the feat with a camel. However, we must abandon this stupid claim, as God would not have allowed mistakes in the King James Version. So, a camel it is.  Next, is it really that hard to put a camel through the needles eye? We acknowledge that it is hard but not impossible. There are many parameters of the equation that can be modified: the size of the camel and the size of the needle, the liquefaction of the camel or its vaporization to ease its passage, and the possible topological transformation of a camel. Please find below some visual aids to help you understand these possibilities.        None of these alternatives is easy, but basically, Jesus never mentioned it would be impossible for a rich man to enter Heaven, just difficult. Is President Trump up to that challenge? Verily, He is!    Quote: Originally uttered by Donald Trump Is there a brick wall getting in your way? Fine. That happens. But you have a choice. You can walk away from the wall. You can go over the wall. You can go under the wall. You can go around the wall. You can also obliterate the wall. In other words, dont let anything get in your way. Get a balance, and then let the positive outdistance the negative.  Dont let anything get in your way! Obliterate the stupid Walls! President Trump loves a challenge and He always wins. Even if there was a wall hard to permeate made of precious stones (Revelation 21:19), President Trump would still get through.  Proverbs 24:16 For a just [man] falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief.  Now we must assess if President Trump is actually rich in the manner that Jesus mentions in those wonderful verses. Actually, He isnt. The life story of President Trump is one of from rags to riches. He started off extremely poor and desperate with no actual help from His parents.     Furthermore, all of the riches gathered by President Trump have been pivotal in order to get Him into the White House. The master plan of Jesus Christ to have Trump channel Gods Will unto America could not have been possible without billions of dollars. Now all this is being used for the benefit of the American voter. Praise Jesus!  Finally, it is time to assess the Spiritual State of President Trump. Above, we saw observational data and it all supported the fact that The Donald will one day sit on Jesuss lap in Heaven. How about testimonial data? What can we learn from there?    Trump has promised to rule with Christ!    He loves the Bible!    Hes a great Christian, a True Christian. This means that no matter what sins He might have committed before being born again in Christ, it is all forgotten now, and Luke 18:25 no longer holds Him!  2 Corinthians 5:17 Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.  These are powerful Testimonials by a man of God and they all agree: President Trump tells us that He is Spiritually mature and ready to meet Jesus in Heaven. Because of what He Himself says, He is.  What about the Bible? What does it tell us? It tells us that Jesus Himself ordained President Trump to take His Godly office.  Romans 13:1 Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.  As we can see, the atheist agenda of false accusations fails miserably. President Trumps abode in Heaven is secure. This was all just wanton persecution by those who align themselves with Satan!    Perhaps this hard-working man will finally find peace and quiet in Heaven and be able to concentrate on perfecting His swinging.    Yours in Christ,  Elmer"	Satire
" Trumps Budget: A Biblical Assessment http://www.landoverbaptist.net/index.php/2017/03/19/trumps-budget-a-biblical-assessment/ Glory! Our President Mr. Donald Trump, the Best Friend of Jesus and President Putin, has released His plans to rectify and cure the Nations Economy. Of course, no True Christian would ever doubt His goodwill and Spiritual Purity when it comes to economics, but it is still worthwhile to scrutinize His Budget against the Truth and nothing but the Truth, the Bible. As we examine the main points of Trumps Budget we shall realize that He must have consulted the Will of Jesus Christ as transmitted in the Holy Bible when He was preparing this document that will remain to serve as a lesson for the infinite future.   First, the Departments with increased funds. Department of Defense: $574 billion, +10% Highly Biblical: The Last Days are a-comin and we must be prepared!  Joel 3:10  Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruninghooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong. [Do not forget Joel 2:20 as it might predict a Canuck invasion and with this real threat we must be vigilant!] Luke 22:36  Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one. Department of Homeland Security: $44.1 billion, +6.7% Highly Biblical: Self-Defence is the Way of Christ!  Romans 13:4  For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil. Exodus 22:2-3  If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die, [there shall] no blood [be shed] for him. Department of Veterans Affairs: $78.9 billion, +5.9% Highly Biblical: Any Soldier doing the Will of Trump is doing the Will of Jesus!  Joshua 1:9  Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest. John 15:13  Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.   Now, before we move on to budget cuts, we must assess our disappointment about the data above. Why are the increases so tiny? These small increases are worth only of $52 billion! Why not much more? Here we must understand that this is only the first year of the Presidency. Well get there eventually, and this is a good start. Let us support President Trump despite the slight disappointment. Now we can move on to the budget cuts, which are even more delightful!  Department of State and USAID: $25.6 billion, -28.3% Extremely Biblical: This money has been spent on false Christians including Muslims and Catholics, foreign cultists and strangers!  Romans 16:17  Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them. Galatians 1:8  But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. Department of Agriculture: $17.9 billion, -20.8% Extremely Biblical: We are on Earth to get a speedy entry pass into Heaven, not to overindulge ourselves with gluttony.  Luke 4:4  And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God. Department of Labor: $9.6 billion, -21.4% Extremely Biblical: We acknowledge that man should work but if someone fails to attain this, it is because of his failure to have Faith in Jesus and pray properly.  2 Thessalonians 3:10  For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat. Philippians 4:19  But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus. Matthew 6:31-32  Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? Department of Justice: $16.2 billion, -20.2% Extremely Biblical: Jesus will judge us. The current system of false judges is just undermining Trumps attempts to protect us and it must be ousted by a Godly judiciary system that assumes guilt unless proven innocent!  James 2:10  For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. Acts 10:42  And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead. Department of Health and Human Services: $65.1 billion, -16.3% Extremely Biblical: The failed health services will be eventually replaced by Prayer Healing. Those who have adequate Faith will be healed and the others wont deserve it anyway!  Acts 4:30  By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus. James 5:16  Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much. Department of Education: $59 billion, -13.5% Gloriously Biblical: We need to listen to the Authorities (Jesus and Trump) and read the Bible and that is all there is to it! This can be supplemented by Creation Science for those of us who are intellectually superior to others!  2 Corinthians 10:8  For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed: 1 Timothy 6:20  O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called: 2 Timothy 3:16  All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: Department of Housing and Urban Development: $31.7 billion, -12% Extremely Biblical: It is a good thing to have poor people in order to make it possible for True Christians to gather Prestige Points by Charity. It we had no more poor, the Will of God would be soiled. Besides, Jesus never worried about housing.  Mark 14:7  For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always. Matthew 8:20  And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head. Department of Transportation: $16.2 billion, -13% Extremely Biblical: The only reasons for travel should be military campaigns and spreading the Gospel!  Joshua 10:7-8  So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valour. And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee. Mark 13:10  And the gospel must first be published among all nations.   Those were the principal points of Trumps Budget. Again, we might be slightly disappointed about His relatively minor cuts concerning un-Godly activities, but, again, its just a start and a huge one. Moreover, we must look at some particular examples to see that things are even better than they seem. Some harmful agencies will cease to exist altogether under the iron fist of The Donald! Praise Him! Ill cite below only some of the most important examples as follows:  Quote: African Development Foundation ($26 million): A foreign aid agency that works on economic development in Africa. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board ($11 million): Created by the Clean Air Act of 1999, they investigates chemical accidents. Corporation for National and Community Service ($771 million): Theyre best known for the Americorps program. Corporation for Public Broadcasting ($485 million): Supports public television and radio stations, including PBS and, indirectly, NPR. Institute of Museum and Library Services ($231 million): Helps fund the nations 123,000 libraries and 35,000 museums. U.S. Trade and Development Agency ($66 million): This agency promotes U.S. exports in the energy, transportation, and telecommunications industries. Legal Services Corp. ($366 million): A congressionally chartered organization to provide free civil legal advice to those who cant afford it. National Endowment for the Arts ($152 million): Created in 1965, they support participation in the arts in communities. National Endowment for the Humanities ($155 million): They support research, education, preservation, and public programs in the humanities. Neighborhood Reinvestment Corp. ($175 million): They support affordable housing programs. U.S. Institute of Peace ($40 million): A federal institution that focuses on conflict prevention around the world. U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness ($4 million): They help coordinate government efforts to reduce homelessness. This means no more Godless arts, museums depicting nudes in marble, libraries filled with trash and evolutionary lies and fake news, prevention of false Christians and strangers fighting each other thus making it easier to Jesus come Rapture (1 Thessalonians 4:17). Overall, the Budget is even more Biblical than previously presumed! Praise Jesus!  No onto the major disappointment.     EPA: $5.7 billion, -30.5% Not very Biblical: Why oh why did The Donald not dismantle this hotspot of atheism. Who worries about the state of the biosphere when its going to be destroyed in the very near future anyway, as Jesus dismisses this sinful place for a Better One (Revelation 21:1)? We can only pray that the the Republican Congress rectifies this mishap as soon as possible to make the Budget Balanced and Totally Biblical. Otherwise, our soldiers will have died in vain!  Revelation 8:7  The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.

James Dobson is Americas #1 expert on womens washrooms, knowing things even I never knew:  Writing in World Net Daily:  If you are a married man with any gumption, surely you will defend your wifes privacy and security in restroom facilities. Would you remain passive after knowing that a strange-looking man, dressed like a woman, has been peering over toilet cubicles to watch your wife in a private moment? What should be done to the pervert who was using mirrors to watch women and girls in their stalls? If you are a dad, I pray you will protect your little girls from men who walk in unannounced, unzip their pants and urinate in front of them. If this had happened 100 years ago, someone might have been shot. Where is todays manhood? So many little-known facts:  A. Women are always comparing themselves to other women, and obsessing over how other women look, but I did not know that they regularly peek into each others cubicles with handmirrors, or that theres no consequences when women are caught doing it. Thats why nobody will notice transexuals doing the same thing.  B. Indoor plumbing is a lot older than we thought. I had thought than in 1916 only the rich had toilets and for everyone else, stumbling across a man peeing into a bush was a regular occurrence, almost as common as seeing horses and barnyard animals answering the various calls of nature. But I forgot that were talking about the good old days, when everything was better, which means that men peeing outdoors is a myth made up by revisionist historians like Howard Zinn.  Howard Zinns bush-peeing propaganda is so pervasive that I have false memories as a result. I could swear I remember myself as a kid peeing behind bushes, or even against walls in alleyways. Boys belong outside my dad would say, and indoors was a strange realm to my generation of boys.Or so my false memories go.  C. Straight teenage boys dont know what vaginas look like, think crossdressing is cool, almost as cool as following rules, that is.  James Dobson knows that there are non-trivial amounts of straight guys who are plotting to become transexuals just to sneak a peek at peeing girls, all to catch a rare glimpse of that most difficult to see bodypart.  I mean, what teenage boy hasnt plotted, a least once, to dress up like a girl and sneak into the girls washroom? Maybe not because you wanted to, but because it would make you look cool (the only reason teenagers do anything). Everybody has, weve only been stopped by the rules, because while teenagers want to look cool, they also know breaking rules doesnt look cool. Becoming a trannie? Cool. Breaking rules? Not cool.  Some people say this fear is obsolete-by-generations stuff straight from Porkies or some other 70s movie about the 50s.That today a few keystrokes on google will give you hundreds of thousands of videos of peeing girls. Maybe our thoughts should be less about Porkies and more about Pornhub?  Quote: Originally Posted by James Dobson I pray you will protect your little girls from men who walk in unannounced, unzip their pants and urinate in front of them D. There are urinals in girlss washrooms. I would have never guessed. Here I was thinking that they just have toilet stalls  because Im not an expert like James Dobson.  Quote: Originally Posted by James Dobson What should be done to the pervertIf this had happened 100 years ago, someone might have been shot. Where is todays manhood? I for one am here.

He has a style of leadership that Muslims and young people respond to:  On May 30th, James Dobson wrote:  If this had happened 100 years ago, someone might have been shot. Where is todays manhood? Less than two weeks later, todays manhood was in Orlando Florida, and 103 someones were shot.  Not that I condone or support actions like the Orlando shooting, but James Dobson clearly did, and if people respond to his leadership, that is a reason to make him Vice President.  3. His efficiency is so legendary, he once organized a 300-person rally for only $70,000  May Day 2010: A Cry To God For A Nation In Distress cost only $70,000 to put together and was lined with evangelical stars  from Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council to Pete LaBarbera of Americans For Truth About Homosexuality to former Presidential candidate and honorary white man Alan Keyes. The purpose of the event? To reach the heart of God and repent of Americas wicked ways, by shaming Americas wicked homos and seculars.  The event was promoted by James Dobson himself:  Quote: Our nation faces what is perhaps the most serious moral crisis since the Civil War as weve turned our backs on God and have clearly displeased him. May Day 2010 is a time to come together and proclaim what God has done in the past, to pray for forgiveness and to plead for Gods mercy on all of us. The effort was so successful that 300 people showed up. Thats only a bit more than $230 each! Friends, it has never been more affordable for you to give God the money He so desperately needs. Only $230 is enough to put a tea partier at a republican rally! For a mere $2,300 you can have a rally of ten, or overflow the sidewalks with 100 ralliers for a donation of a mere $23,000!  Imagine how liberal false-churches would have spent that $70,000. Feeding the hungry, who would just get hungry again, clothing the naked, which would just make them sweatier and smellier, sheltering the homeless, which was to blame for the mortgage meltdown. Dont lose your money to those greedy wastrels! Money is best spent on this:  Quote: Originally Posted by May Day 2010.org Join with Christian leaders of all denominations who love God to humble ourselves, pray, seek the face of God, and turn from our wicked waysindividually and as a nation. This event is not to impress the media or those in Washington, but to reach the heart of God. Publicly repenting and crying out to God for His mercy instead of the judgment our many sins deserve. Repentance in personal and corporate prayer to God and remembrance of His work throughout our nations history will be major parts of the day as we seek God to do a great work of revival or reformation in our time. The tentative plan is to begin the day with an hour of worship and praise.   Now THAT is what I call repentance! Now lets see those homos and divorcees and seculars and, worst of all, Dakota Fanning with sackcloth and ashes, scourging themselves, with gnashing of teeth and rending of clothing and they repent their sins! But of course, they dont, because theyre so full of themselves, with their gay parades and their arrogant I dont need the threat of hellfire to behave decently.  Well if their gay parades are so great, why cant they organize ones that only cost $230 per person?  4. He will win the war on terror by working with Muslims, like when he teamed up with an Islamic sex cult to help them teach American kids  Like it or not, we are going to be involved in the Middle East for a long time. We need a vice president who is used to working with Muslims  Religious politics has been a story of strange bedfellows uniting against a common evil. In the 19th century, Protestant churches united to fight Catholics. In the 20th, Catholics and Protestants united to fight non-Christians. In the 21st, we see all religions uniting to fight against scientists:  Youngstown, Ohio students are learning creationism in school with materials from a Islamic, Holocaust-denying group accused of being a sex cult Harun Yahya, whom The Daily Beast has covered before, is a pseudonym for Adnan Oktar, a creationist cult leader and Islamic televangelist who owns Turkeys A9 TV channel.  Anne Ross Solberg, an expert on Yahya, explained in a paper that while Oktar uses many of the same arguments as Christian creationists, and undoubtedly takes inspiration from American-style creationism, Yahyas creationism is far from just an American import (PDF). Hes trying to prove that science backs up Islam.  The message of Yahya is thus that science does not only confirm the existence of an intelligent designer, but divine creation as revealed by Allah, Solberg writes.  Oktar has also hinted that hes the Mahdi, a messianic figure in Islam, whose coming will signal the end times, and that his fight against evolution is part of fighting Islams Antichrist, the Dajjal. Most likely Republicans are working with him because he knows more about science than scientists. On the other hand, they might be playing along because they got blackmailed:  Oktar has been accused of blackmail where he snared powerful people with sex.  As the criminal indictment vividly illustrates, young girls were lured into sex parties with the promise of being admitted to the group, but ended up having to perform sexual acts with men of influence, whom the group needed for its economic and political success, wrote the New Humanist, describing the charges against Oktar. The encounters were filmed and used to coerce the men in question to act in the groups interest. How effective has the program been? I bet Islamic creationists are doing a better job than those cucks weve trusted to teach creationism so far.  Christians cuckservatives can hardly convince kids to pull their pants up. Islamic conservatives convince kids to blow them selves up.  Clearly theyre good at their job.  5. Hes used to working with Mexicans. Real Mexicans.  Lets face it, the only way to get the Great Wall of Trump build on budget is to use Mexican labor to build it. James Dobson works with Mexicans, and not the fake, assimilated ones you see on TV. I mean the real Mexicans, the one who say Cahones in every sentence, and who think the age of consent means shes out of her diapers:  Colorado Independent:  A Colorado Springs man who narrates the Bible in Spanish on CDs and works in the Spanish broadcasting department of Focus on the Family appeared in court Monday in Golden on two felony counts of using the Internet to lure a 15-year-old girl for sex, The Denver Post reports.  Ovalle, a native of the Dominican Republic, is listed as the Voice Narrator/Artist of the Spanish Reina Valera Biblia, available on 64 CDs, and can be heard here discussing an upcoming Focus on the Family conference with directors of the evangelical empires outreach to the Spanish-speaking community. 6. He supports bullying  Trumps foreign policy is not to make war on powerful enemies, but instead to bully our weaker friends. Whether its Mexico, or NATO, our trade partners, or even the Vatican, he his plan is to bully them until they end up the sucker, instead of us. He thinks nothing of tossing schoolyard taunts at everyone from cripples to tortured prisoners of war, and thinks calling a woman ugly is an instant-win condition. Clearly his Vice-President needs to share his philosophy.  Focus on Family says anti-bullying efforts in schools push gay agenda  Focus on the Family urges adults to look out for children who are being bullied, and then pile onto them, because bullying victims are gay. Among the approved bullying tactics is showing your adult penis to them.  http://www.focusonthefamily.com/docsA000000264.cfm  the boys father has to do his part. He needs to mirror and affirm his sons maleness. He can play rough-and-tumble games with his sonHe can even take his son with him into the shower, where the boy cannot help but notice that Dad has a penis, just like his, only bigger. Thats right. Want your kid to grow up straight? Put him in an environment where he cannot help but notice large penises. Works every time.  James Dobsons Focus on the Family has also posted a delightful series of articles on how to instill your children with the proper gender identification. The first piece is called Is my child becoming a homosexual? and it basically says that if your child exhibits gender confusion,theres a good chance that hell turn into a fruit:  Evidences of gender confusion or doubt in boys ages 5 to 11 may include:  1. A strong feeling that they are different from other boys. So if your son is different from other boys, hes well on his way to becoming a homosexual. Make sure to stamp out his individuality at all costs, and discourage him from developing any original thoughts or ideas.  2. A tendency to cry easily, be less athletic, and dislike the roughhousing that other boys enjoy. And make sure that Remember to make up for Timmys lack of athleticism by screaming at him during Little League sporting events, and fighting with the other parents.  All heterosexual males enjoy sports because it involves getting hot and sweating with a bunch of guys, taking mass showers, slapping backs and et ceteras, and dominating other guys through physical abuse. Those that engage in this behavior the most are ideal examples of straightness.  3. A persistent preference to play female roles in make-believe play. If you catch your toddler trying on mommys shoes, slap him.  4. A strong preference to spend time in the company of girls and participate in their games and other pastimes. Similarly, dont let your daughters hang around boys who like spending time with girls. You can read more about this in another Focus on the Family article, called Is My Daughter Becoming a Fag Hag?  5. A susceptibility to be bullied by other boys, who may tease them unmercifully and call them odd, fag and gay. Pretty self-explainatory.  6. A tendency to walk, talk, dress and even think effeminately. Yes, even if your son walks, talks and dresses like a man, there could be covert gayness lurking deep within his thoughts. You might want to hook him up to an E-Meter and show him pictures of Chippendale dancers to see if he gets aroused. (And if he does, seek professional help.)  7. A repeatedly stated desire to be  or insistence that he is  a girl. If your child is experiencing several signs of gender confusion, professional help is available. Its best to seek that help before your child reaches puberty.  And definitely before he buys his first Cher album.  By the time the adolescent hormones kick in during early adolescence, a full-blown gender identity crisis threatens to overwhelm the teenager, warns psychologist Dr. James Dobson. To compound the problem, many of these teens experience great waves of guilt accompanied by secret fears of divine retribution. Fears that are completely justified, mind you: if God catches your son playing with dolls, Hes liable to smack the turdloaves out of him.  In short, if your boy isnt out there beating up on smaller children, if they get good grades and they like to try to get along with everyone, well, therere certainly gay. Boys that are bright, precocious, social and relational, and artistically talented are not only gay, theyre bottom gay. 6. When he prayed for Obama to be stuck by lightning, his prayer was almost answered:  http://www.9news.com/news/elections/7203&catid=348  A video producer for Focus on the Family is asking people to pray for rain when Sen. Barack Obama (D-Illinois) makes his speech at the end of the Democratic National Convention in Denver. Granted, God did not answer the prayer, but thats only because Obama looks better in the rain. As in, rock-star better:    But of course the prayer was not about looks  no election has ever been swung by some rain, either in the Bible or in the historical record. He was praying for Obama to be struck by lightning, something that God does many times in the Bible. (Job 1:16, 2 Samuel 22:15, Psalm 18:14, Luke 9:54, )  God did not answer the prayer word-for-word, but He has shown His support for the sentiment, by sending lightning bolts very close to the White House:"	Satire
" Latest Trump-Tweet Orders Dreamers, Trans, & Lingering Burning Man Participants To Erect Border Wall http://www.dailydiscord.com/?p=12471 Nogales, AZAn angry Tweet from Donald Trump has enslaved thousands of snowflake liberals for the single purpose of building his promised border wall. The President told the press today, I said the Mexicans would pay for the wall and clearly some of the folks we detained this week are pretty brown, really brown people. Sure, some are just tan because we picked them up in the desert, but some started out that pigment. We are working with the people at AncestryDeport.com to sort out the real Americans from the wetbacks. Dont worry, folks, many brown people will be constructing and/or paying for this wall. When the Feds swept the desert at the close of Burning Man, we picked up a whole bunch of progressive flakey, hipster-types, and thats when I told AG Sessions, Hold onto those freaks. I have an idea  [Sharks with firggin lasers attached to their heads joke removed by the editor]  When asked about violating Habeas corpus, which protects Americans from being detained without due process, Trump said, We didnt violate nothing. Haebus whatsus is a very foreign word, its very foreign. Foreign stuff translates to my base as not American. I have worked with my people, the best people, to replace Carpeas whatsus with the words Tweeteas Oftenus. This will allow people to be detained by me, in 140 characters or less on Twitter. Once detained they will become an indefinite part of the wall effort. #WeBuiltThisCity.  Vice President Mike Pence attempted to quell fears today, We have real, legal executive authority to detain these people as not having a wall along our southern border constitutes a matter of national security. Most of these folks will be returned to their lives when the job is done, at least those working on the north face of the wall. Ha!"	Satire
" Mar-a-Texo? Trump Floats Turning Houston Into Giant Golf Course Waterpark http://www.dailydiscord.com/?p=12444 Tweet TowerThe Trump Organization is looking to borrow money from the Kremlin to help transform downtown Houston from its current soggy state to a lush and sprawling golf course resort. Many are calling this win, win, unless you happen to own property in an existing water hazard. President Trump pitched the idea to Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner at a ballgame today, during a flood delay. The President believes an elite golf course with this many natural water hazards will attract some of the best golfers across the globe. The best!   Proponents of the plan believe the resort will both revitalize downtown Houston, while cutting costs on restoring water damaged sections. If approved by the city, the resort complex will encompass nearly half of the remaining flooded Metro area. The planned Trump Restored Ultra Mega-complex Pavilion (TRUMcP) will offer stunning views of the Houston skyline as well as provide the perfect spot for special events, weddings, and ongoing rescue efforts.  Trump told rally-goers at nearby Beaumont, Hey, I said I would drain the swamp, but I never said I would drain this one. Ha! A lot of people are telling me, Donald, if you use Russian bank money for this project they will say its more collusion. Ive had a lot of time to think about the word collusion and what it means to collude. I can even use it in a sentence now. Collude: I loved that old movie When Worlds Collude. That was a good movie. See, I made two sentences! Im here til Friday! No really, Im being told I should stick around this soggy shithole for the optics. Oh, and I can use optics in a sentence too.  The President is denying rumors he might accidentally nuke Galveston so his new resort complex property will become part of the Gulf coast. When asked about the possibility of using the U.S. nuclear arsenal to sweeten a current real estate venture, the President said, Well see. No options are off the table.  Meanwhile, General Mattis is angered by the question and warned satirists, Please dont give this asshole anymore ideas."	Satire
" Americans appalled by Trump presidency turn to cryonics for escape http://www.bentspud.com/news/science-technology/2017/06/28/americans-appalled-by-trump-presidency-turn-to-cryonics-for-escape/ More and more Americans embarrassed by the incompetence and disgracefulness of Donald Trumps presidency have turned to or are seriously considering  temporary cryonic suspension to escape the unbearable political climate in America. Two of the countrys top companies specializing in cryonics  the science of deep-freezing humans and animals with the intent of reviving  them at a later time  have reported a steady increase in inquiries and sign-ups from citizens disgruntled with and disgusted by Trump. Evelyn Mulcahy, a spokesperson for Alcor Life Extension Foundation in Arizona, said they started getting emails and phone calls from people  immediately after Trumps U.S. Electoral College victory in November last year. We initially thought they were just pulling pranks, but it soon became very clear that these were very serious people, said Mulcahy.  Mulcahy said the most common question they field is how much it would cost to be cryogenically frozen and then revived on January 20, 2021,  when Trump presumably leaves office. Others are more conditional and specific, she said. I recall someone in particular who had asked if they could be frozen and then revived once Trump was removed from office or sent to jail,  said Mulcahy. It is absolutely unbelievable, the amount of interest out there right now, and I think it will only keep getting more intense.  Cryonics expert Dr. Greg Jensen, who works for Alcors rival company Cryonics Institute in Michigan, echoes Mulcahys assessment. I think its rather unfortunate that we have a President who is so embarrassing and so deplorable that he utterly drives people to think  about literally freezing themselves just so that they can escape the shame in being an American right now, said Jensen. It speaks volumes.  Jensen said that of the thousands of temporary cryonic suspension inquiries they have received, only a very small percentage actually committed  to the procedure. We obviously cannot reveal names and numbers, but yes, we do have people frozen and waiting to be revived once Trump is out of office or in  jail, said Jensen.  According to Jensen, the reason for this is the high price point. The average cost of vitrification perfusion and long term storage can run  upwards of $28,000. Once they find out how much it would cost, majority of the people inquiring completely drop the idea and just decide to stick it out and  weather the embarrassment of the Trump administration, said Jensen."

" Jeff Sessions sets Guinness record for number of times 'I don't recall' uttered at U.S. Senate hearing http://www.bentspud.com/news/politics/2017/06/14/jeff-sessions-sets-guinness-record-for-number-of-times-i-dont-recall-uttered-at-u-s-senate-hearing/ United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions has made it to the Guinness World Records after uttering I dont recall or variations  thereof a total of 32 times  the most by a witness under oath  during his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee  on Tuesday.  The previous record was held by drug-induced amnesia test subject Doris Canter, who uttered variations of I dont recall 28 times  during a hearing held by the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare in 1976 regarding the safety of the anesthetic Midazolam, a  powerful drug that causes amnesia as a side effect.  Guinness Editor-in-Chief Craig Glenday confirmed the Attorney Generals feat after his contentious appearance before the Senate  committee to answer questions regarding the Russia investigation.  I am happy to confirm that U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions is now the record holder for saying I dont recall the most number  of times during a witness testimony while under oath, Glenday said in a statement.  Sessions testimony raised more questions than it answered and further entrenched the cloud of uncertainty hovering over the Trump  administration about allegations that Trump aides may have colluded with Russians to influence the 2016 general election."

" Trump appoints golf club office cleaner as Health Secretary http://www.bentspud.com/news/politics/2016/11/20/trump-appoints-golf-club-office-cleaner-as-health-secretary/ Bedminster, New Jersey  In a move further indicative of how he intends to lead and govern the United States, president-elect  Donald Trump has appointed an office cleaner at his New Jersey golf club to lead his incoming administrations Department of Health  & Human Services.  46-year-old Rodrigo Elizalde, an immigrant from Venezuela, clinched the position after he walked into Trumps office while the  brash billionaire-turned-statesman was discussing potential candidates for the position with his closest advisers.  Seemingly unable to decide who to appoint, Trump saw Elizalde as he was emptying the garbage can and asked him if he wanted a  new job. Startled, Elizalde smiled and said yes, according to Trumps campaign manager Kellyanne Conway.  To be honest, Im not sure if Mr. Elizalde even knew what he agreed to on account of his English being not so great, but President  Trump knows what he is doing. We simply just have to trust him, said Conway.  Conway said Trump knew Elizalde for a long time and was always pleased with his ability to keep everything in the office spot-free  and shiny.  In an official statement from Trump released to the press, the former host of The Apprentice said of the new Health Secretary  appointee, in the 10 years that he has worked for me cleaning my office and scrubbing my toilet, there was never a complaint  about Mr. Elizaldes work ethic and output. He always delivered and oftentimes exceeded the standards of cleanliness and sanitation  that I have personally set. I am fully confident that he will be a great Secretary of Health And Human Services.  When reached for comment, Elizalde said he is honored to be given this great opportunity and promised to work hard as Health  Secretary to ensure the health and well-being of all Americans. Until his appointment is confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Elizalde  said he intends to continue cleaning president-elect Trumps golf club office.  I am not ashamed of my work. A decent way to make a living should always be a source of pride for anyone, Elizalde said.  Conway said Elizaldes appointment as Health Secretary should put to rest all talk of Trumps racist tendencies.  Its clear that Mr. Trump is not a racist. He just proved it by appointing a Latino immigrant office cleaner as a member of his  Cabinet, said Conway."	Satire

Whether staffers leave voluntarily or are forced out, parting Team Trump is such sweet sorrow well, except the sweet part. This is why Chief of Staff General John Kelly was determined to make leaving the premises quicker and more enjoyable for all involved. He opted to install a zipline that spans 1,287 feet and leads from the Truman Balcony all the way to an open sewer grate on 17th Street.  General Kelly told the Discord, My first idea involved a revolving door, but that implies some aides and staffers might be returning at some point, which is simply not the case unless they want to be shot. Thats when I thought of the zipline, because it allows staffers to have a little fun on the way out, something apparently none of them experienced here.  President Trumps former Chief Strategist, Steve Bannon, is already crying foul. WTF? I just left? said Bannon. Hell, the seat in my office is probably still warm.

We had already called in the coordinates and the Australian Navy was on the way.The pilot refused, so I fired him. I took over, since I have a pilots license, and landed the plane in the water about 40 yards offshore.

It was the left-handed thing that did him in, Bryant said. Hes got no right-side game, so I all I had to do was block him out on the one side and he was toast. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Obama was especially competitive when it came to their one-on-one game. Ive played a few pickup games against Barack before and Ive never seen him like this, Gates said. He was running around like a madman and swearing to himself. I didnt even have to let him win. Gates wasnt the only one to feel Obamas b-ball wrath. I didnt even really want to play, said Pete Rouse, Interim White House Chief of Staff. I dont even like basketball and Im definitely no good at it, but Mr. Obama was insisting that everyone play. While Rouses matchup provided comic relief, todays games showed a different side of the President, a slightly maniacal side. Maybe now the Republicans will see just how much they have in common with him. Who am I kidding?"	Satire
" New WikiLeaks Documents Reveal George W. Bush Actually Made Some Of His Own Decisions http://www.sensationalisttimes.com/new-wikileaks-documents-reveal-george-w-bush-actually-made-some-of-his-own-decisions/ WASHINGTON  Its only a small insert on page 112,115, but the new files leaked by the infamous website WikiLeaks provide almost undeniable evidence that, during his presidency, George W. Bush did in fact make some important decisions for himself. The documents have only been partially released on the WikiLeaks website, but The Sensationalist Times received an advance copy of the entire contents. According to records kept by the White House, Bush left most important decisions up to his staff, aides and other people he hired to do shit around the Oval Office. Condoleezza Rice even made a few decisions herself, although her role during the Bush administration remains, for the most part, an enigma. However, when it came to food, Bush usually insisted he have the final say. I ordered those Cinna Stix from Dominos tonight, reads an entry in the younger Bushs diary, which was apparently confiscated by a Democrat ninja and which was released by WikiLeaks. Its not the best thing Ive ever had. I asked Rumsy and he said he didnt think it was too great either, so it wasnt just me. Apparently, Bush also decided upon the specific flower types to be included in the White House Garden and put the clamp down on any rumors that surfaced about a possible Nintendo Wii in the White House. Laura thinks we should get a Wii for the girls, reads the diary. NEVER!! Im a PS3 guy! This new information totally dispels the belief that George W. Bush was just a marionette being controlled by a Republican party that knew just about as much as him. Finally Bush can be recognized for his decision-making prowess. While he may not have known how to run a country, one can no longer doubt his ability to pick an answer in a multiple-choice situation."	Satire

It was submitted to the federal government but denied because of a clerical error on the application by the Obama administration. Last night it collapsed, and Obama has now been told that cost him the lives of two of his pals.Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin were traveling in a 2017 Ford Crown Victoria with two Secret Service agents when the bridge collapsed, sending them into the Nimbolosci river  the fifth strongest current in the world.

" U.S. FISH & WILDLIFE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING ABUSING ITS POWER http://www.satirewire.com/content1/?p=6465 WASHINGTON, D.C. (SatireWire.com)  Overlooked as scandals swirl around the White House, Justice Department, CIA, EPA, and FBI, the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service said today it could get up to some pretty abusive shit if thats what it takes to get a little attention around here.  People dont think of Fish & Wildlife as being ripe for overreach and corruption, but we can be a real hotbed of intrigue, insisted regional director Brian Wills-Perry. Weve never been asked to hack into phones or doctor crowd photos or attack Yemen, but we could do other stuff. You give me a drone and I can blow a hole in a rainbow trout, no problem.  I wouldnt, of course, he quickly added. That would be horrible. Animals are our friends. But we could, is what Im saying, so how about a little media scrutiny for the old U.S. FS&W?  As part of the Interior Department, the Wildlife Service faces steep budget cuts under the Trump administration, reductions that have been all but ignored by the press, which is focused on scandals at larger agencies. Susan Kaldek, assistant director of the migratory birds division, said the media is really missing a big story by discounting the departments controversial work on surveillance.  Ill bet you didnt know, because reporters werent doing their jobs, that just last year we searched a marmoset den without a warrant, Kaldek admitted. And every fall and spring, we capture thousands of foreign nationals. Specifically Canadian Geese. And when I say captured I mean in photos. God theyre majestic  But the point is, you think our borders are porous in terms of people getting through? Look up, my friend. No wall is going to keep out a great blue heron, she added.  Fish and Aquatic Conservation director Jim Freeman, meanwhile, said the Wildlife Service is not above a security leak.  So the FBI leaks Russian contacts and the CIA leaks entire conversations, but what if I told you were working on a follow-up to our 2010 report, Early Life Stage Mortality Rates of Lake Sturgeon in the Peshtigo River in Wisconsin? he said. And what if that accidentally got into the hands of Field & Stream a few weeks early? Jake Tapper will be all over my ass.  Late this afternoon, with the media still focused elsewhere, Freeman was seen carrying a snowy egret, a small staple gun, and a migratory tag out onto the National Mall.  Ill do it! Ill incorrectly tag this egret in a sensitive part of its brilliant white plumage! shouted Freeman, tears running down his face.  He will, hes crazy! Freeman added, speaking out of the side of his mouth in hopes onlookers would think the egret said it."	Satire

And look out Beijing  sexy Rexy will be there Saturday, according to someone who has access to the Secretarys agenda and therefore is not in the media.

" CANCER ENDORSES REPUBLICAN HEALTHCARE PLAN http://www.satirewire.com/content1/?p=6475 WASHINGTON, D.C. (SatireWire.com)  Republicans picked up a major endorsement today as the worlds leading patient-based health related entity  Cancer  came out in favor of their proposed Obamacare replacement plan.  Speaking on behalf of the many, many millions of patients for whom I am responsible, the American Health Care Act is a vast improvement on Obamacare, Cancer said in a written statement. Several aspects of this legislation, such as eliminating the individual mandate, cutting Medicaid for the states, and increasing costs for the poor, sick and old, represent great strides forward on the road back to where things used to be before Obama got involved.  The statement conceded the bill is by no means perfect, but urged Republican hardliners to vote in favor.  To my friends in the Freedom Caucus  and my special friends the Koch brothers  I realize this legislation does not have everything we both want, Cancer said. To you, it still allows people to get government support for healthcare. To me, it still allows people to get healthcare. But I urge you to join me in supporting AHCA, as I believe this bill takes a giant and much-needed step in our direction by eventually sending many more people in my direction.  The surprise endorsement was announced Thursday, and without much fanfare, during a briefing by White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer:  SPICER: Good morning. One update on the American Health Care Act. Support for this landmark legislation continues to grow. It now has the backing of House and Senate Republican leadership, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Health and Human Services, Cancer, Grover Nordquist, and medical device manufacturers. Questions?  CNN: Sean, whats the next wait, did you just say the bill has the support of Cancer?  SPICER: Yes. And the Chamber of Commerce and medical device manufacturers.  AP: Right, but Cancer? You dont mean the American Cancer Society?  SPICER: Um no. No, I believe theyre opposed. I can get back to you on that.  AP: No, thats all right. So Cancer endorses this bill.  SPICER: Yes. The President strongly believes that everyone should have a seat at the table and he has been negotiating with a very diverse group of interested parties, including Cancer, which said it particularly likes dropping the individual mandate.  NYT: Because fewer people will end up with health coverage?  SPICER: I believe that was Cancers primary interest. When it saw that provision, it was very excited. Spontaneously self-replicated. Literally went from a stage 3 to a stage 4.  WSJ: Sean, why would the White House want Cancers support when the bill is opposed by hospitals, doctors and patient groups like the AARP?  SPICER: With all due respect to them, Cancer is by far the largest patient-oriented entity on the planet. Every single day its in direct contact with more people than either the AMA or AARP, and the President appreciates this wide base of support.  FOX: But shouldnt the President be against Cancer?  SPICER: No. Cancer has said some very complimentary things about the President, so the President feels obliged to be complimentary in return. As he told me just last night, Wouldnt it be great if we could get along with Cancer?  FOX: But Cancer is a killer.  SPICER: Hey, there are a lot of killers. You think our country is so innocent?  Cancer could not be reached for comment as no one really wanted to try."	Satire

(SatireWire.com)  In what it called a show of great compassion, the Trump administration today announced it will allow all female illegal immigrants to stay in the country if they rate an 8 or higher.  Critics blasted the idea as blatantly sexist, and pointed out Trump had once promised to only deport illegals with criminal records. Press Secretary Sean Spicer, however, said the new order is entirely consistent with earlier promises as, Mr. Trump believes that being anything less than an 8 is a crime.  Reading a statement by the President, Spicer said women who qualify for the new F8+ visa will be allowed to remain in the United States if they meet three criteria: They have to respect our laws, they have to learn English, and they have to keep their weight down, he said.  According to immigration scholars, about half the roughly 11 million illegal immigrants in America are female. Approximately 2.2 million of those women are between the ages of 17 and 34, specified by Trump as the only age group capable of attaining an 8 or better, Spicer said.  Through the F8+ program, the President shows his great compassion, said Spicer. He will not turn a blind eye toward those who come here seeking a better life, but will in fact stare at them, at close range and from several angles, in both formal dress and swimwear.  In related news, Spicer said the President will hold a get-to-know-you session with female members of Congress in the form of a, Ms. Congresswoman Pageant."	Satire

(SatireWire.com)  In what they called a historic compromise, Republicans in Congress today said they will no longer oppose abortion in cases where the mother lives in a Democratic district.  Democrats immediately protested, calling the Senate bill cynical, calculated and malicious. Republicans, meanwhile, claimed they were surprised by the opposition.  I dont see the problem. The left claims its pro-choice and were saying, Fine, choose, said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, (R-KY). The last thing this country needs is an unwanted Democrat.  Its really a liberal compromise on our part, added House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI). Even though our base staunchly opposes any cooperation with the other side, we are crossing the aisle and saying, Go ahead. Kill yourselves.  In fact, some of our members suggested we make abortions mandatory in Democratic districts, Ryan said. Honestly, were going out of our way here.  On the Senate floor, Democrats said the sudden about-face on abortion is another cynical attempt by the GOP to reign in the opposition.  State-by-state and law-by-law, theyre attacking democracy, said Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, (D-NY). Theyre restricting immigration, theyre making it more difficult to vote, and now theyre trying to literally create fewer Democrats. You cannot claim in one breath that all life is sacred, and in the next breath say some lives are less sacred.  Yes we can. Just did, McConnell responded."	Satire

He used a press conference today to condemn foreign hurricanes travelling to the US. These hurricanes are a drain to the American taxpayer and they can expect the authorities to keep a very close eye on them. When these hurricanes get here, theyre not sending their best. Theyre bringing floods, theyre bringing rain, theyre rapists. Hurricane Irma has been classified as the worst storm in Atlantic history, or as climate change deniers call it: bad luck.

President Trump had no choice but to fire one of them last month when he ruled that Sharia Law was OK if the defendant is Moslem and reasonably expected to follow his faith or face eternity in hell. You can force a Christian to pay for birth control for indigents and gutter rats but you cant ask a Moslem not to beat his wife? Sounds about right. Today, President Trump very quietly ended the tenure of the Moslem 14  as they have named their little group of Allah worshippers  with an executive order eliminating their benches altogether. White House Propaganda Director Emmanuel Goldstein told Fox News: President Trump doesnt have the authority to remove a federal judge appointed and confirmed by the Senate, but he does have the authority to determine the number of benches in the judiciary per the Evacuation Clause. He reduced that number today by 14. Brilliant. Thats why we voted for President trump and why well vote for him again. Hes waaaaaaay smarter than we are.

" Trump to Nominate Chris Christie to Supreme Food Court http://nationalreport.net/trump-to-nominate-chris-christie-to-supreme-food-court/ TRUMP TOWER  President-Elect Donald J. Trump has reportedly assured NJ Governor Chris Christie that, despite recent reports, he has not been banished from his inner circle, and will nominate the Bridgegate behemoth to the Supreme Food Court.  Mr. Trump decided it would be humorous to have his little Christie Kreme (his new Secret Service name, according to insiders) around, so he created the special position just for him, says Trumps longtime attorney/bankruptcy expert, David Friedman.  In selecting Christie, 54, The Donald will be bringing in a yes, Ill have another man that wont clash with his own oversize, portly ego. I think Mr. Trump wants Christie around just so he can humiliate him, said Trumps chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, and he knows hell do whatever he says, whenever he says to do it.  Despite rumblings of a massive falling out between the two, those closest to the president-elect say otherwise.  Jared Kushner, the husband of Trumps daughter Ivanka, said a Christie nomination would be a wise one, and would produce instant results. Mr. Christies transition from the gravy train to the Trump train was seamless, he said. I think he would shake things up and make an enormous impact.  Stephen Miller, who played a crucial role in Trumps campaign, including drafting his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, says Christie has a gargantuan-sized heart and is the perfect fit for the new court.  Governor Christie is not only pro-life, but he understands the birthing process better than anyone I know, Miller said, and as far as the 2nd Amendment is concerned, Ive seen that guy conceal a .30-06 in the crease of his back fat. Trust me, theres nothing to worry about. Miller joked that Christie loves and supports the NRA almost as much as KFC. He will step up to the plate, thats for damn sure.  While often referred to as the butterball of the Grand Old Party Sub, it appears Mr. Christies nomination to the Supreme Food Court is already a foregone conclusion."	Satire

Trump swore off any and all assistance from the U.S. intelligence community, stating he did not trust the briefings he was set to receive as the nominee. I wont use them because theyve made such bad decisions, he said at the time.  The Washington Post recently reported that a team of intelligence analysts has been prepared to deliver daily briefings on global developments and security threats to Trump in the two weeks since he won, but hes passed on all but two meetings. Offered daily access to sensitive and classified information from around the globe, the U.S.s incoming leader  who has no governmental or military experience  simply declined, declaring hed rather receive his daily briefings over his favorite social media platform, Twitter.  I like Twitter because it trims off all the fat, Trump told Fox News, if you cant get your point across in 140-characters or less, then it cant be that important anyways.  Trumps team says the president-elect has been focused on the transition and selecting the members of his administrations Cabinet and say he still has plenty of time to get up to speed on international affairs and security threats before he takes office.  The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Republican Rep. Devin Nunes, who is also a senior member of Trumps transition team, told the Post that he is not concerned about Trumps Twitter preference.  National security is Donald Trumps No. 1 priority and hes taking it very seriously, Nunes said. Look how many leaders hes met with, how many phone calls hes taken, positions hes filled. So what if he uses Twitterhes getting the job done.  Mr. Trump has tweeted almost two dozen times in the last two days, including a barrage of multi-tweet criticisms of the press, a violent tweetstorm about the popular vote and possible fraud, and his latest proposal; to jail or revoke citizenship of people who burn the American flag."

Were just trying to get the thoughts and prayers out as quickly as possible, a spokesperson for the administration said, and if we can get the public to have an equally dedicated campaign to collect Facebook likes for these victims, we can really mitigate the worst of this.  FEMA director Adam Brown told reporters earlier today that retweeting victims posts really helps, please do that as much as possible. This is a serious issue that we cant just swipe left. Reports from the agency had indicated earlier today that upvoting could have some impact, but reacting on Facebook with a wow or, even better, the angry face would most likely be what turns the tide in effective response to this region.  If you want to do literally everything you can to help the victims in Texas, you should like this article, then share this article, then like the one you shared and then comment so that your friends get engaged and then they start tagging people and everyone talks about how much it sucks and everyone posts pictures, said President Obama. Then go relax to your favorite show and have a beer. Youve earned it.  Story update: Victims are now saying they have received too many thoughts and prayers and will have to send some back.

Trump has already been raising eyebrows with his cabinet and adviser selections.  Trump tapped Jeff Sessions as his Attorney General when Sessions was deemed too racist for a federal judgeship back in the 1980s. Hes asked Steve Bannon, an executive for Breitbart News, which frequently publishes white nationalist and white supremacist news under the banner of the alt-right movement, to be his Chief Strategist. This week he announced that South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley will be his U.N. ambassador despite having no experience in the State Department, and has reportedly asked Dr. Ben Carson  a chief rival during the Republican primaries  to be his Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  At a press conference late Tuesday night, Trump gave some insight into his thinking process in inviting Carson into the role of HUD secretary.  Well, I mean, you know, hes um, one of them, isnt he, Trump asked rhetorically.  Reporters asked Trump what he meant by one of them. The president-elect first just winked back at the reporters. When they didnt understand what he meant, he tried touching his nose. Exasperated, Mr. Trump finally answered the question in his trademark way.  Look, hes one of them, you know what I mean, Trump said, you know, his people are into jazz and they have an extra muscle that makes them good sports.  The press pool was still not quite sure what he meant. Trump tried again to explain to him why he was choosing Dr. Carson for his HUD secretaro.  Its got the word urban in it, right, Trump asked, and when we think of urban we think of people of a certaintype, right? You know they all smoke marihuana cigarrettes and their women are Jezebels, strong sexual appetites, know what I mean?  Still, the reporters werent quite understanding what Mr. Trump was getting at. He dug in even further.  Cmon people, follow me here, Trump implored them, the job has the word urban in it, hes an urban. You know, an URBAN. Like, his people are incapable of self-care and sink into lunacy under the burden of freedom.  Looking puzzled, members of the press pool still couldnt quite understand what Trumps meaning was. They pushed for more clarity. Growing ever more flustered, Mr. Trump tried to oblige.  You know, he could be a minstrel, Trump offered, hes a good song and dance man, get it? Like, hes not going to go swimming any time soon, no matter how long ago he ate. Get it now? Huh?  After fifteen more minutes of trying to get the reporters assembled there to understand him, Trump finally gave up. He dug into his pocket, and got out some black shoe polish. He also got out a large rag and started smearing the polish all over his face, except around his eyes and mouth, there he left his trademark orange skin intact. He began singing.  Everything seems lovely when you start to roam, Trump sang out, continuing, The birds are singin, the day that you stray. But wait until you are further away. Things wont be so lovely when youre all alone. Heres what youll keep saying when youre far from home. Mammy, Mammy. The sun shines east, the sun shines west. I know where the sun shines best.  The media simply grew quiet, their jaws agape.  Mammy, my little Mammy, Trump forged on, My heartstrings are tangled around Alabammy. Im comin, sorry that I made you wait. Im comin, hope and trust that Im not late, oh oh.  Mammy, my little Mammy. Id walk a million miles for one of your smiles. My Mammy, oh oh.  No one knew what to do, or what to say. So they just kept taking notes as Trump sang on.  Mammy, my little Mammy, Mr. Trump bellowed forth, The sun shines east, the sun shines west. I know where, I know where the sun shines best. Its on my Mammy Im talkin about, nobody elses. My little Mammy. My heartstrings are tangled around Alabammy. Mammy, Mammy, Im comin. I, I hope I didnt make you wait.  Now, it seemed that trump was building a crescendo. He was clearly ready to bring it all home. The reporters still just watched in stunned amazement.  Mammy, Mammy, Im comin, Trump sang, Oh God I, I hope Im not late. Mammy look at me. Dont you know me? Im your little baby. Id walk a million miles for one of your smiles  My Mammy!

The 41-year-old agent of the Pyongyang regime is said to have given himself up to authorities and does not wish to return to North Korea. It is after allegedly living in a free democratic society under cover as a spy that he realized that he never wanted to go back to North Korea. He told us that life in North Korea is a living Hell and that he would do anything he could to never go back explained Guam police spokesman, Henry Xian to reporters. He said that its while eating ice cream that he decided to surrender to Guam to local authorities, because he had never tasted something so good in his entire life and that it tasted like Heaven he concluded, visibly amused. A taste of Heaven The extreme poverty in which the North Korean people live could explain the actions of the spy according to North Korean political expert, Andrew Lee Gibbons. The abject state of poverty in which the North Korean people live is horrendous he explains. Basic food supplies are frequently lacking and the people are constantly living in a permanent state of famine. Ice cream, chocolate or even sugar are luxury items reserved for the elite of the regime he added. North Korea leader Kim Jong Un appears to have backed away from a threat to fire missiles towards the US Pacific territory of Guam, opting instead to wait and see what the foolish Yankees do next."

" TRUMP SCIENCE ADVISOR DENIES APOLLO MOON LANDINGS EVER HAPPENED http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/trump-science-advisor-denies-apollo-moon-landings-ever-happened/ Donald Trumps newly appointed science and technology advisor, Yale University professor David Gelernter, has already attracted a barrage of criticism after making controversial statements this week during an exclusive interview with Science Today. The controversial computer scientist already known for his strong stance against the science behind global warming has openly and vehemently criticized the space policy of the Barack Obama administration and its goal to reach Mars in 2030.  How can we manage to organize a U.S.-crewed orbital Mars mission by the mid-2030s when we never even went to the moon? The idea is laughable, as was Obamas administration, if I may add   Yale Professor David Gelernter The Apollo moon landings are the biggest fraud in mankinds history, even worse than all that global warming nonsense, he added. A voyage that never was This is not the first time the controversial professor has attacked the Apollo moon landings. In his 2012 book America-Lite: How Imperial Academia Dismantled Our Culture (and Ushered in the Obamacrats) the author voices his concerns about the impossibility of space travel outside the Earths magnetic field. In the modern age, we have never been outside the Earths magnetic field. With the exception of the alleged 24 human beings who flew lunar flights in the Apollo program during the four-year period spanning 1968 through 1972, all human spaceflights have taken place in low Earth orbit (LEO) or below. Even the International Space Station conducts all its operations in LEO, he explained in his book. Why is that? This is because orbits higher than low orbit can lead to early failure of electronic components due to intense radiation and charge accumulation, he wrote. A dangerous belt of radiation The Yale professor also documented in his book how NASA was, and still is, aware of the impossibility of traveling beyond the Van Allen Belt, a highly charged radioactive belt that is part of the planets magnetic field. The Apollo missions were supposed to be the first event where humans traveled through the Van Allen belts, which was one of several radiation hazards known by mission planners, but even today, NASA scientists admit they cant get past the Van Allen Belts he claims in his 2012 book. If NASA scientists honestly admit in 2012 that they still havent worked out how to properly shield the spacecraft from the radiation emitted from the Van Allen belts, how the hell did we send human beings into space covered in aluminum foil suits? At a particular time when the Solar activity was at its peak? The answer is simple: It just never happened, he concluded on the matter. Despite his controversial claims, David Gelernter is a world-renown and multiple award-winning computer scientist known for his contributions to parallel computation and his early prediction of the rise of the World Wide Web. Time Magazine profiled Gelernter as one of the 100 most influential people of the 21st century in 2016, describing him as an arch-genius.

Although I am part of a global network of mercenary hackers who were employed to help Trump win the election by leaking damaging information on the Clintons, I am ashamed and scared to say I played a part in putting a dictator into the reins of the most powerful country the world has ever known, a situation which could easily turn into a third world war he added, visibly distraught by his own actions. Although I might be putting my life in danger, I am doing this for my son and future generations, he explained. Leaving some clues behind The hacker claims he sabotaged his own work to lead the CIA and FBI investigation towards finding the culprit behind the DNC hackings. When I realized the reason we were hacking the DNC emails was to help push Donald Trump into the Oval Office, I started to sabotage my work and leave some clues which would lead them to Russia, he told reporters. I purposefully switched to a Cyrillic keyboard during the hackings and inserted Russian language into the malware he boasted, visibly proud. I also made sure the compiler, or the piece of software that compiles the code so that it can execute, always dated time stamps. The time stamps were in a time zone for the business hours of Moscow and St. Petersburg and other places in Russia and the IP address always pointed to a Russian address. Something a professional hacker would obviously never do, he confirmed. I made sure to leave tidbits of sabotaging information which would lead any organization inquiring into the hackings directly to the Russian government, he added, before ending the conversation. Dimitri Zhirinovskys name became public this week after Icelands Minister of Foreign Affairs, Gulaugur r rarson, confirmed to journalists that the Russian government had officially demanded the extradition of several individuals linked to the DNC hackings by the CIA and FBI reports, demands the Icelandic government has refused."

" ALIENS MEDDLED WITH U.S. ELECTION CLAIMS CONTROVERSIAL EXPERT http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/aliens-meddled-with-u-s-election-claims-controversial-expert/ The famous publisher, producer and TV show host, Giorgio A. Tsoukalos, says he has some irrefutable evidence that an extraterrestrial civilization influenced the American presidential election in order to help Trump win the White House. Mr Tsoukalos was invited on the show L.A. Tonight to discuss various topics, when he made an astonishing declaration concerning the federal election. He said that hed found some evidence that aliens had used an elaborate mind-control device to make Americans vote for Donald Trump. We know this isnt the first time that aliens meddle with elections in the United States, claimed Mr Tsoukalos. Theyve helped Abraham Lincoln, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan in their election campaigns, and they just did the same thing with Donald Trump. According to him, an unidentified extraterrestrial civilization brainwashed and manipulated the American people by emitting some sort of low-frequency sound wave that enables them to program the minds of humans. The aliens are so advanced technologically that they have the means to manipulate us at will, he said. They simply implant ideas in our minds, and most people dont even realize that these ideas arent theirs.  The controversial host of the TV show Ancient Aliens, explained that aliens had a very complex agenda and they probably have some very good reasons to want Donald Trump to be elected. He claims he has evidence to prove his claims and will reveal them to the public in a week or two. Mr Tsoukalos is well-known for defending the controversial Ancient Astronaut theory, which claims that extraterrestrial life forms have interacted with humans at many different moments in history and shaped many the greatest known civilizations. This is the first time, however, that he makes allegations of alien implication in such a recent event and his claims instantly generated a lot of reactions on the social media. Many people are trying to guess what his irrefutable evidence could be and elaborating a lot of strange theories, while others are openly questioning Mr Tsoukalos mental health or insulting him."

Tania Whitmore, a devoted militant for the Hillary Clinton campaign, allegedly used her Ford Escape SUV to trample her husband, Darrell Johnson, after he told her that hed voted for Trump. Investigators believe that her vehicle was going at more than 65 miles per hour it hit Mr Johnson, around 7:30 this morning. After the collision, it changed direction and ended up crashing into a large tree. Officers of the San Diego Police Department rapidly arrived on the site, and were fortunately able to arrest her before she had time to finish her spouse. Id forgiven him for cheating on me with both my sister and my best friend, but this was too much! she shouted after her arrest. The jerk deserved to die! Mr Johnson was rapidly transported at the UC San Diego Health Center, where he remains in a critical but stable condition. The surprising result of the last presidential election is causing a lot of tension across the United States, and this violent incident seems to be just another manifestation of the generalized discomfort surrounding Donald Trumps victory. Protesters hit the streets again on Sunday, marking the fifth day of demonstrations in cities such as New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Protesters are upset about Trumps policies on health care, the environment, LGBT rights and other issues. Many protesters are questioning the legitimacy of Trumps victory over Hillary Clinton by noting that although he took the Electoral College, Clinton won the popular vote by a large margin. "	Satire

" Rachel Maddow Hiding Out in Cave After Releasing Trumps 2005 Tax Returns https://www.suchpolitics.com/the-archives/2017/3/16/rachel-maddow-hiding-out-in-cave-after-releasing-trumps-2005-tax-returns Following her tweet releasing President Trumps 2005 tax returns, MSNBCs Rachel Maddow retreated to the hills when word got out that the Trump administration planned on tracking her and making a public display out of her going against the White House.  The controversy of Trump not releasing his tax returns has been discussed since the voters demanded that the public see them during the presidential primaries, however until now they have not been released at all. Almost immediately after Maddow released the tax returns, a memo was sent out around the White House that she be detained and made an example of. While the memo was unclear about what that meant, many are speculating it to be some sort of tar and feathering in the D.C. town square based on how many chickens were brought to the White House later that night.  Maddow hopped into her 99 Subaru and fled as soon as she heard word of the private memo, telling only a few trusted colleagues of her whereabouts so they could restock her with cliff bars and green tea if need be. One of which happened to be her long time special event co-anchor Brian Williams.  Honestly, Id be surprised if they found her, Williams said. That Maddow is a crafty one. Shes been preparing for a moment like this for years, and has been putting 5% of her annual paycheck into decking out her hideout cave. It really is a nice cave, its got everything you need from a customized LA Lakers minifridge to those wonderful sharper image massage chairs. Im not sure why she didnt do this years ago.  The Trump administration have assigned 1,200 National Guard members and a team of police dogs to search for her. Based on interrogations with friends and family they believe her to be somewhere either in the Blue Ridge or Rocky Mountains. They are considering bombing the mountains and just getting rid of her all together, while hopefully finding oil under them, however they have yet to come up with a distraction for the public to pull that off.  Maddows family expects her to be in hiding for well over three months, providing Trump does not give up before then. They are confident that she will not be found, as she started the extreme hide n seek club at her college, and was the school champion for all four years. Her mother believes that there are still people looking for her at the old campus library, which does not bode well for Trump."	Satire

Time and time again, our partys leaders have drafted and presented health care bills to repeal and replace Obamacare. Weve tried this thing from all possible angles, but the backlash to each potential bill has been so severe that we havent been able to get anything passed. Where is all this negativity coming from?   Hooey pb cover web Bob Odenkirk is a legend in the comedy-writing world, winning Emmys and acclaim for his work on Saturday Night Live, Mr. Show with Bob and David, and many other seminal TV shows. This book, his... We had Paul Ryan take a crack at an alternative health care bill, but he blew it hard. Then, Mitch McConnell stepped up to the plate, and he also blew it hard. Now, this thing is in the hands of Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy, but constituent phone calls disparaging the bill are flooding all of our offices. This has forced our party to ask the American people a very important question: do you not want us to kill a few million people or something?  Look, were trying our best here. At any given point, we have twelve or so of our best and brightest old white men working on a health care alternative to Obamacare. A bunch of guys named Bradley and Ralph will not rest until working class Americans are screwed over real badly. Its disheartening because were trying so hard, yet the American people still seem intent on rejecting any legislation we present just because a few million people might die. Its almost like you people dont want us to murder a huge chunk of the country.  Yes, we were the obstructionist party for eight years and we halted as much legislation as possible. But, now that we have control of Congress, were hell-bent on getting stuff done. We want to pass legislation! So, why wont the American people just let us pass a health care bill thatll treat pregnancy like a pre-existing condition and raise premiums for sick people? Its completely ridiculous that you wont let us kill a lot of poor people. Is that what this is all about? The millions of people who will die because they wont be able to afford health care if we pass one of these bills? These very negative reactions to our death bills confuse and demoralize us.  Do you not like the name of the bill or something? Just say the word and we can have one of the Bradleys try naming the new health care bill something a bit more flashy. We just want to understand why so much skepticism is getting tossed our way. Is it all the impending death and suffering that any of these bills will entail? That cant possibly be it. Why would so many average American citizens be against a systematic culling of the countrys working class, elderly, and disabled populations? It doesnt make sense to us at all.   At risk 4 Trump wants these narrators and authorsor their full civil rightsgone. Support our immigrant, refugee, Muslim, and LGBTQI writers, editors, and storytellers by buying their books and reading... Lately, we feel like we just cant win with you. Please let us pass a health care bill and kill a few million people. What is so wrong with that? Just let us do it. At the very least, youll need to explain to us why you disagree so intently with us unleashing a legislative plague across America.  Sincerely, The GOP"	Satire

The Dreamers have to go to protect the future of our children, he said. If we let these people take over, our children will end up working as gardeners and maids for them. Buchanan has penned several books and articles warning about the dire future of America with a majority brown population. According to Right-Wing Watch, conspiracy theorist Josh Bernstein says deporting the Dreamers was necessary for conservatives survival. He said Democrats and Dreamers would eventually create a one-party state and target right-wingers.

Donald, I know you love our country but its time to hang it up, Obama is quoted as saying. Let Mike take the reigns.

In what appears to be a throwback to the days of Watergate, President Donald Trump has reportedly organized a band of so-called plumbers to investigate serious leaks at the White House. Anonymous confidential informants, all members of the White House staff, reported that the president is so disturbed by incessant leaks that he has ordered attorney general Sessions to head the search. Sessions has told other cabinet members that the leaks cannot continue, and that drastic action will be taken to curtail them. He has threatened to subpoena reporters who may have learned of the leaks from the White House staff. The New York Times, in an editorial today that refused to identify sources, revealed that the current leakage is unrelated to the leak revealed in May. At that time, as reported in a Spoof exclusive, the problem was not technically a leak but was a backup and toilet overflow caused by an an ancient, unpumped White House cesspool. The Times' informants say the present issue is multiple leaks somewhere in an as yet undetermined pipe in the president's bathroom. Sean Spicer, filling in for the new press secretary as Spicer prepares to leave the White House staff, said that if Sessions is in fact seeking the source of the leak, he would indeed need plumbers but that neither the president nor the attorney general feel that term is acceptable today.

" Susan Sarandon's vagina: 'I am with Hillary' http://www.bentspud.com/news/politics/2016/03/29/susan-sarandons-vagina-i-am-with-hillary/ Los Angeles, CA  In a startling turn of events, Susan Sarandons vagina has gone on record and declared she is throwing her  full support behind Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton.  The move is in direct opposition to the actress spirited and sometimes aggressive backing of quirky socialist dreamer Bernie  Sanders, who is Clintons last remaining stumbling block in the path to the Democratic presidential nomination.  Susan is right, she doesnt vote with her vagina, said Sarandons vagina, referring to the actresss Twitter post on which  she said she doesnt vote with her female genitalia. Because I, like many other vaginas, have a mind and voice of my own, and for anyone to insinuate otherwise is incredibly insulting to vaginas everywhere.  Sarandons vagina, who goes by the name Nancy Aubergine, said she believes that out of all the politicians running for the highest  office in the United States of America, Hillary Clinton is the only one who has the realistic plan and the experience to steer  the country in the right direction.  As a vagina, I truly believe in my heart of hearts that Hillary will do great things for America, said Aubergine. For me,  experience matters. Hillarys track record as a public servant speaks for itself.  Aubergine added that she doesnt understand why Sarandon (and anyone for that matter) thinks Bernie Sanders would make a great  president.  I think its rich that a 74-year-old man who has been in politics longer than anyone running for president would paint himself  as a revolutionary while besmirching Secretary Clinton as being part of the establishment, said Aubergine. If anyone is part  of the establishment, its him. He invented the establishment.  Let me tell you, if Bernie Sanders were a gynecologist, I most certainly would not let him touch me with a 10-foot pole, said  Sarandons vagina.  Hillary Clinton is currently leading the Democratic presidential race with 1,243 pledged delegates, while Bernie Sanders recently picked up an interest in ornithology."	Satire

Meaning these degrees were all about history and theory about deviance and social justice. Few liberal arts Criminal Justice degrees programs actually covered police tactics. Recently as liberal anti-police feelings have grown these CJ programs have shifted to also bashing police. Chief Irving from Sothern California explained it this way. We got a group of rookies who only want to argue with training officers. One kid said he refused to arrest anyone due to the stigma an arrest can have on their general wellbeing. Countless police administrators echo the complaints of Chief Irving. Deputy Chief Billets told us about a rookie who would not issue traffic tickets. This kid id out there pulling over speeders and then having them research traffic crash statistics and write an essay. He claims tickets unfairly penalize the poor.

" Trump: Putin Will Be Honored Guest At Inauguration http://bizstandardnews.com/2017/01/12/trump-putin-will-be-honored-guest-at-inauguration/ President-elect Donald Trump might be having trouble attracting celebrities to his inauguration, but at least one foreign leader will show up, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. According to a press release, Trump was excited about the news. Im very happy to have Vladimir honor us with his presence, said Trump. Ill make sure the United States and Russia have the best relationship ever. Trumps presidential win has been marred by intelligence reports that Russian hackers and propaganda helped sway the election in his favor. A recent report by BuzzFeed detailed an investigation by a former British intelligence agent who claims that the Russians are using sex tapes and financial ties to compromise Trump. Trumps election might indicate how much power Russia has over the United States. According to ThinkProgress, a recent speech by U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters, which was critical of Trump, was knocked off C-SPAN and replaced by Russia Today, Putins propaganda outlet. The incident occurred six days after the U.S. intelligence community released its declassified intelligence report about Russias meddling in the presidential election, said ThinkProgress writer Aaron Rupar. A significant portion of it details RTs efforts to help Donald Trump."	Satire

" Steven Seagal on short list for new FBI director  In the weeks after the FBI director was fired there has been speculation as to who will take over as Americas top cop. A White House insider has provided CallTheCops with a tip about one name on the list. Actor and reserve deputy Steven Seagal. Talking to us anonymously our source said the next FBI director needs to be someone with police experience and able to work with the current administration. Deputy Seagal would be a good fit.

" Trump angers paramedics by calling them ambulance drivers in EMS week speech  President Trump is overseas for the 2017 EMS week. But that fact is not what has EMS workers as upset as what Trump said in a recent speech. Trump called paramedics ambulance drivers. In a speech live streamed to various EMS week events the President praised the work done by all who render pre-hospital care. He drew criticism with many EMS works when at one point in his speech he said. TrumpI mean, I am a healthy man so we have never needed you to respond to my amazing penthouse in Trump Tower. Believe me, I know how incredible the men and woman ambulance drivers are, these are great people. We dont pay them a lot of money like doctors and nurses but they do the same incredible work. Many EMS shocked by this statement. It harkened back to a similar flub made by President Obama during a State of the Union Address. Later in his video stream, the President talked about how his reforms to the health care laws would allow him to raise the minimum wage for EMS workers. The president did not give an exact number. The discussion of EMS pay was a second insult to the many volunteer EMTs who serve US communities. EMT Jack Johnson said this. I thought he was all about supporting us folks in uniforms. Then he goes and calls us by a derogatory term. I do more than just drive the booboo bus. Pulse I do it for free. 100% volunteer here. Am I less of a medic because I dont get paid? City EMS director Chris Janson had this thought. After 30 years of being called an ambulance driver, I have gotten used to it. What bugs me more president after president gives a speech in person during police week. But during EMS week, nada we get shit. When asked for a comment Press Secretary Sean Spicer claims the term Ambulance Driver is an alternative title."	Satire
" War on Christmas named bloodiest war since WWI http://thedailyer.com/war-christmas-named-bloodiest-war-since-wwi/ As Christmas season continues in full swing, many people are embracing the Christmas spirit by decorating the house, singing Christmas carols and getting in last-minute shopping. However, behind this jovial spirit lays the hideous and destructive nature that the Christmas media does not want you to know about.  Just announced last Sunday, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter announced that the War on Christmas has been named the bloodiest war since Americas involvement in World War I.  The War on Christmas started as a harmless right-wing talking-point about how Jesus is being fazed out of Christmas, but has quickly turned into something far more treacherous.  Although the phrase bloodiest war may look alarming, Carter would like to point out that there have been no casualties in the War on Christmasjust a whole lot of blood.  More people have died from eating cereal than in the War on Christmas, Carter reiterated using a fancy graph. However, there been an ungodly amount of blood spilled during this battleon the streets, at shopping malls, on set during live recording. Blood is everywhere, and as of right now we are still looking for causes.  The search continues for answers as to where this record amount of blood is coming from, but Carter has a few leads.  Well, definitely keep our eyes peeled on certain hot spots: malls, offices, Fox News headquarters, specifically Bill OReillys studiothat man looks like he has a lot of blood in his body, Carter said. Our main focus, though, will be various Starbucks to see if any red cups make individuals angry enough to bleed profusely.  Political conspiracy theories often only cause citizens to be annoyed on Facebook and Twitter, but the War on Christmas has reached new levels of terror, making this the bloodiest, yet least dangerous, war of all time. This may not be the most pressing issue, Carter said, but blood on the streets is something he wants to end.  Im not a doctor. I do not know much about the human body, but I know losing blood to a media talking point is bad, Carter said. Right now, its important to remain calm and remember that the War on Christmas will end when we all put away our decorations and start celebrating the new year. "	Satire
" Report finds Firefighters at risk due to exposure to the chemical Dihydrogen Monoxide http://www.callthecops.net/report-finds-firefighters-at-risk-due-to-exposure-to-the-chemical-dihydrogen-monoxide/ It seems everyday there is a new risk to being a firefighter. Chemicals found on fire scenes and absorbed into turnout gear have been linked to many illness. Now a chemical found in fire hose is raising an alarm. Fire AttackA newly published scientific study in the Journal of Chemical Reaction and Human Hazards in Extreme Workplace Environments, sheds light on this new chemical danger. According to the study Dihydrogen Monoxide is a colorless and odorless chemical compound. At room temperatures it is a non-viscous liquid, but at high temperatures as found in fires it can turn into a vapor. Inhalation of Dihydrogen Monoxide can cause respiratory distress. Death will result from an excessive amount being inhaled. Exposure to the vapor from Dihydrogen Monoxide will cause burns. Again death is a possibility with an excessive exposure. Fire hoses release Dihydrogen Monoxide during normal firefighting operations. The researchers offered no recommendations on dealing with the dangers of Dihydrogen Monoxide. There have been no long term studies to check the effects Dihydrogen Monoxide contact has with human and the likely hood of it triggering other illnesses. More studies on the effects of Dihydrogen Monoxide will be needed to find out the full extent of the danger to firefighters."	Satire

Trump recently fired White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer and Chief of State Reince Priebus after about six months in office. Orange Throat said the White House is like Game of Thrones with less blood. Trump also reportedly considered firing White House advisor Steve Bannon, when he started getting more praise than him. According to the Washington Post, an unnamed White House insider also compared the ongoing carnage to HBOs Game of Thrones. Priebus final departure was a humiliating coda for what had been a largely demeaning tenure during which he endured regular belittling from rival advisers  and even, at times, the president himself. His exit was described by one Republican strategist as the red wedding, a reference to a mass-murder blood bath episode of HBOs Game of Thrones, said the Post."	Satire
" IRAN PLANS TO BOMB HOLLYWOOD http://weeklyworldnews.com/headlines/55237/iran-plans-to-bomb-hollywood/ Iran is planning to bomb Hollywood over the Oscar-winning movie Argo because of its unrealistic portrayal of the country. Several news outlets, including the pro-reform Sharmin daily, said today that French advisors are in Iran for talks with officials over how to destroy Hollywood. The decision on the bombing reportedly came after a group of Iranian cultural officials and movie critics screened the film in a closed audience in a Tehran cinema. Argo, which won the Best Picture Oscar this year, tells the story of the escape of six American hostages from the besieged U.S Embassy in Tehran in 1979. The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance met for a one-day conference called The Plague of Hollywood on Monday night. It said the distortion of historical facts in films including 300 and Argo prompted them to meet and to arrange a nuclear attack on Hollywood. Conference secretary  Shibani Liberani was quoted as saying: One of the main aims of the meeting is to unify all cultural and military communities in Iran against Hollywood. Last month Iranian officials dismissed Argo as pro-CIA, anti-Iran propaganda and state television called it an advertisement for the CIA.. Mohammed Hosseini, Irans Culture Minister, described the film as a distorted history. Argo has been banned from Iranian cinemas, but bootleg copies are believed to be available.Iran did not say when the bombing would begin but Hollywood executives are saying they will counter with bombs of their own.   Arnold Schwarzenegger is reportedly a consultant for Hollywood."	Satire
" A Simple Explanation Of Trump's Russia Scandal http://www.cracked.com/blog/a-simple-timeline-all-trumprussia-news/  Wow, what a week to be burdened with literacy and a conscience. It doesn't even matter where you sit on the political spectrum -- Left, Right or in a corner softly weeping -- every fan in DC was caked with shit being thrown from all sides. So much happened that it can be pretty confusing to keep it all together, and it's even more confusing when you factor in that so much news was jumping back and forth from things that happened weeks or months ago to real-time insanity. Luckily for you, I abuse drugs meant for horses, so I took the time to let someone else at work research it for me so I could give it to you!  April to November of 2016  Turns out that during Donald Trump's presidential campaign, not only was he selling record numbers of ugly hats (don't hate, you know it's true), but his cadre of questionably scrupled pals also had a few more undisclosed meetings with Russians than we were aware of. And by a few I mean 18. 18 undisclosed contacts with Russians.  A lot of these contacts seem to be between Michael Flynn, disgraced national security advisor, and Sergei Kislyak, Russian supermodel and ambassador. The nature of the contacts was email and phone calls. Can we assume a romance? It's up to the FBI to find the sexts. For now, the focus is on their efforts to set up backchannel communications -- which, again, sounds like romance. You know, for some of us.  June 15, 2016  In what must be a super fun, party-like shindig, awesome dudebro Paul Ryan and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy have a meeting wherein the topic of Russia and Ukraine came up, and McCarthy casually mentions that he feels Trump is on Russian payroll. Specifically, McCarthy says, There's two people I think Putin pays: Rohrabacher and Trump, referring to California Congressman Dana The Mad Russian Rohrabacher.  Some folks laugh at McCarthy's claim, then Ryan says No leaks! A good time is had by all. Those involved at first denied the conversation ever took place, until it was pointed out that it's on tape, after which they decided it was clearly just jokes. C'mon man, don't you know a knee-slapper when you hear one?  January 4, 2017  Ruh-roh! Despite assertions that the Trump team had no idea Flynn was more foreign than a guy in a Speedo on the beach, word is that they had been given plenty of advanced warning. It was Flynn himself who told White House lawyer Donald McGahn that he was being investigated for being a shady foreign agent and taking boatloads of sweet, sweet Turkish money.  January 10, 2017  Despite basically saying Don't hire me, I'm going to fuck this up, Flynn is hired and promptly sets about fucking this up. On January 10th, Flynn decides that the Obama administration's plans to work with Syrian Kurdish forces to fight ISIS by taking the city of Raqqa is crap. Trump is still 10 days from being president, but the Obama officials need his team to sign off on it. Flynn says no, delaying the operation and also supporting the position of Turkey, which is opposed to U.S. forces teaming with Syrian Kurds. Oh, also Turkey had paid Flynn $500,000 previously for his secret lobbyist job.  January 20, 2017  Intelligence officials warn Israel not to share sensitive info with Trump because it might get back to the Russians. Ha ha ha! Isn't that silly? How would info get from the president to the Russians? If this was a Choose Your Own Adventure novel, we'd ask you to move to May 10th, but it's not, so don't skip ahead yet!  January 26, 2017  Sally Yates goes to the White House to warn officials that Flynn could be open to blackmail by the Russians. Oh man! That's warning number two!  February 13, 2017  Flynn resigns as national security advisor. Or he's fired. Depends who you read. On the 13th? You bet on the 13th!  February 14, 2017  It's Valentine's Day, and love is in the air! According to memos written by James Comey, then-head of the FBI, Donald Trump urges him to drop the investigation into Flynn's ties to Russia. Word is Comey didn't feel comfortable with Trump, so he kept extensive notes on their interactions. According to his notes, Trump says I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. If that's true, many analysts have said it could amount to obstruction of justice and be grounds for impeachment. Trump probably never thought of that because he doesn't like peaches, only well-done steak.  April 25, 2017  Trump sends a text to Michael Flynn telling him to stay strong, according to Flynn. Because of course that happened.  May 9, 2017  President Trump fires Comey, the man leading the investigation into the his administration's alleged ties with Russia. The reason provided is that Comey bungled his handling of the Hillary Clinton email server (sure). Trump says he consulted with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who had recused himself from the Russian investigation, as well as a letter drafted by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.  May 10, 2017  Around now is when the shitsnowball gets pushed off the top of the hill and shit starts accumulating fast. Trump has a meeting at the White House, in America, not as a joke, with Sergey Kislyak and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. Never mind the widespread suspicion that Russia tried to influence the U.S. election in favor of Trump, they still got an invite. Who doesn't get an invite is American press, shunned in favor of the Russian media, which the White House claims was sheer trickery. They thought that Russian photographer was just doing glamour shots.  At the meeting with the Russians, Trump decides to share classified intel about ISIS garnered from Israeli sources. Word is the info is so top-secret that even allies like Canada and the UK don't have it yet. But now Russia does! Neat-o.  At this same meeting, Trump tells the Russians about firing Comey, referring to him as a real nut job. He then goes on to explain that this will take the pressure off that pesky Russia thing and, as a garnish, tells them he's not being investigated.  May 11, 2017  In an interview with Lester Holt, Trump contradicts his earlier statement regarding the firing of Comey by stating, When I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said 'You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.'  May 16, 2017  Trump goes on Twitter to explain sharing top-secret info with Russians. As President I wanted to share with Russia (at an openly scheduled W.H. meeting) which I have the absolute right to do, facts pertaining to terrorism and airline flight safety.  Supporters are quick to point out that he's right. The president can declassify and share any info he wants whenever he wants. Critics point out that's kind of missing the issue, and everyone in the White House probably hurried to change their pin numbers and passwords, unless they wanted their nudes leaked to the Russians.  Officials are worried that Trump's disclosure put the life of an operative working within ISIS in danger. Meanwhile, a bot campaign arises, quickly picked up by FOX news, which accuses Hillary Clinton of murdering former staffer Seth Rich.  According to the story, a PI has evidence that Rich, who worked for Clinton's campaign, leaked info to WikiLeaks and was later murdered. The PI then says that's not true and that he'd heard it originally from a FOX reporter. Rich's family says it's not true and begs for a retraction, as there is no evidence from any law enforcement that Rich ever contacted WikiLeaks. Despite that, numerous just-made Twitter accounts which today are no longer active spread the story like creamy bullshit peanut butter until it went viral.  Meanwhile, back at the ranch, all this news is apparently too much for House Republicans, who start turning on Trump and demanding to see and hear from Comey, as well as read whatever files he might have had pertaining to his investigation. Then again, none of them seem willing to impeach. In fact, John McCain says that talk of impeachment is not rational. If he's ever engulfed in flames, he'll probably tell the firemen, Now don't be hasty.  May 17, 2017  Ever-helpful Vladimir Putin says he has a transcript of the meeting between Trump and the Russian officials, which he's happy to share and will surely be trusted by everyone and isn't just Putin trolling hard as a mofo.  Meanwhile back at the ranch again, former FBI director Robert Mueller is appointed special counsel in the Russia probe by Rod Rosenstein. Most people take this as a good thing. Maybe not Trump, but most people.  Michael Flynn keeps things interesting by so far ignoring a subpoena. Waiting for a sweet deal? Who's to say? Maybe ask a Russian ...  May 18, 2017  Yeah, Trump definitely didn't like the Mueller thing. After special counsel is appointed, Trump says he's the victim of the greatest witch hunt in American political history and also says no politician has ever been treated worse than him. The internet explodes in guffaws and references to JFK, Lincoln, and Mandela. Others point out how he spent the better part of Obama's administration leading the birther brigade. But whatever, who has time for irony?  May 19, 2017  Trump takes off for a delightful trip abroad. At the same time, news breaks that Jared Kushner is being looked at as a person of interest in the Russia probe, and that investigators are now looking to see if White House officials have actively engaged in a cover-up.

" United States to build wall around D.C. http://thedailyer.com/united-states-build-wall-around-d-c/ In reaction to a long, arduous election cycle filled with finger-pointing, scandals, and plenty of drinking as a coping mechanism, the 50 states wasted no time in deciding to erect a wall around Washington, D.C.  The project started simply as a joke Facebook event created by 19-year-old Pennsylvania resident Zoey Mattigano, but quickly garnered attention nationwide, with 10.3 million Facebook users RSVPing to the event at press time.  I was just trying to make light of this situation at first, but I guess people really liked the idea and took it seriously. A states rights organization contacted me and asked if they could take over the event and start organizing the construction of an actual wall, Mattigano told The DailyER. I told them, Yeah sure lol and they just went hard at it.  The organization, known as The States Congress, had actually begun planning prior to permissions from Mattigano to take control of the event page.  We were just so excited and surprised that nobody had thought of this idea before, States Congress member and wall architect Donavan St. Germain said.  St. Germain briefly went into the details of the proposed wall, stating that building around the 40-mile perimeter of Washington, D.C. will be much cheaper and more easily monitored than the roughly 2,000-mile-long U.S.-Mexico border wall proposed by President-Elect Donald Trump.  Since the length will be 50 times shorter than what is proposed by Trump, we can make it higher and add more bells and whistles to it and still make it affordable, St. Germain said. Elon Musk reached out to us and said he wanted to contribute an experimental laser defense system in case any U.S. Congressmen or lobbyists try to escape. Plus, this way we can make sure Trump doesnt go and embarrass the nation on international trips. We also plan on installing Internet jammers along the wall.  It looks like America can unify behind a single cause after all."	Satire

Mulvaney, 62, has been with Hillary since before she moved into the Governors Mansion in Arkansas.  Unfortunately for her, her work visa, which had expired and was set to renew, was lost in processing. She was facing two options: Get sent to Mexico, a country she hasnt visited in 4 decades, or tell federal prosecutors everything she knows about Hillary Clinton.  She chose the latter after her request for a lawyer was denied ion the grounds that shes not being charged with a crime. Shes simply being given an option to avoid deportation.

" Ben Carson Stranded in Middle of Escalator After Stairs Stop Moving https://thelapine.ca/ben-carson-stranded-on-escalator/  MIAMI  Just minutes after being freed from a stuck elevator in a low-cost housing building, HUD Secretary Ben Carson became stranded on an escalator that suddenly stopped working.  I went to my place of inner peace and found calm in the storm, Carson told reporters after they finally coaxed him to walk up the 20 or so non-moving escalator steps.  Carson had remained standing on the escalator and gently swaying for nearly 15 minutes before an NBC reporter took him by the arm and led him up the stairs.   Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson stuck on stopped escalator. Photo credit: Jaylene Ebbs. My decades being a neurosurgeon taught me that there are no challenges in life that we cannot overcome with serene thought and prayer, a visibly relieved Carson said as he hugged strangers and reporters alike.  Low-cost housing tenants protesting against Dr. Carsons push to implement Donald Trumps $62 billion cut to housing assistance say the escalator made a squealing noise before slowly coming to a stop, leaving Carson standing about 2/3 of the way up.  He looked up at all of us waiting for him on the second level but he just stood there, said one onlooker.  Didnt move a step even though we were all telling him to just  you know  walk up the stairs. Weird stuff, gotta say.  NBC 6 Miami reporter Alina Machado finally went down the stairs and convinced Carson he didnt have to wait for the escalator to be repaired and then was able to lead him to the top by the elbow.  Im not certain what was going through Secretary Carsons mind that made him believe he was stuck on the escalator. Nope. I have no idea whatsoever, Machado said in her news bulletin afterwards.  Dr. Carson became a bit emotional when he stepped off the stalled escalator. We were all very confused.  Carson (65) has often referred to himself as a cloud person, a term he has never clearly defined when pressed by media or even colleagues. The New York Times has frequently used the term atypical thinker to describe Carson after interviews where he has offered opinions on everything ranging slaves having been immigrants to the pyramids being built to store grain and brew whiskey.  When things happen on the outside, we need to listen to our insides outside and outsides inside, Carson told the small, confused crowd before wandering off in the direction of the malls food court.  Secretary Carsons communications aide was unable to clarify this comment for reporters.  William Yum Reportering for The Lapine"	Satire

" Kushner Says Stress from Russian Witch Hunt is Harming His Looks https://thelapine.ca/jared-kushner-says-stress-from-russian-witch-hunt-is-harming-his-looks/  WASHINGTON  After briefly restating that there was no collusion in his 5 or 6 unreported meetings with Russian contacts, Jared Kushner surprised reporters this afternoon by leaning forward and pointing out some faint wrinkles around his eyes.  And then inviting a cameraman to touch his dull, limp, lifeless hair.  These lines?  These crows feet?  This is what all the fake news about Russia and Putin is doing to me! I have crows feet! And my hair has totally lost its bounce and sheen! Kushner said emotionally before pointing out the bags under his mahogany eyes.  The pressure is constant and Im seeing its horrible affects on me in the mirror 20 or 30 times a day, said Kushner.   Portrait of Jared Corey Kushner hanging in greeting room of Ivanka and Jared Kushners Washington home. Oil on canvas. Artist unknown. 2016. Im only 34 years old and these unwarranted attacks are stressing me out  the wholesome, youthful appearance that Ive prided myself on is fading even as we speak, continued Kushner (36).  Kushner serves as Senior Advisor to the President  his father-in-law Donald Trump  and is currently embroiled in multiple investigations into Russian manipulation of the 2016 federal election. He spoke to reporters about his complete innocence and the sadness of losing his boyish good looks but refused to answer questions about saying it was all Donald Trump Juniors fault during his closed-door grilling by both the House and Senate Intelligence Committees.    Soafter much memory searching, it turns out I did meet with 6 or maybe 7 groups of Russians. But I go to dozens of meetings every week at the White House, in various hotels, in cars, sometimes out of the country  its easy to forget 7 or perhaps 8 meetings with Russians, Kushner said before turning back to his worries about his appearance.  Yes, my friends tease me about looking like an innocent, clean-cut teenager but its just locker room talk. Boyish looks aside, I am totally focused on fixing everything thats wrong. Fixing. Every. Single. Thing, he said.  What CNN, the New York Times and Hillary Clinton are doing should be illegal! Theyre giving me worry lines and oily skin. And this, said Kushner as he stuck out his heavily coated tongue saying its further proof that the pressure is affecting his youthfulness.  White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci issued a brief statement immediately following the media show-and-tell defending Kushners health and beauty concerns and noting Kushner was runner-up to Dwayne The Rock Johnson as People Magazines Sexiest Man Alive in 2016.

" Chelsea Clinton to Receive Emmy Award for Lifetime Achievement http://www.thedailyrash.com/chelsea-clinton-to-emmy-award-for-lifetime-achievement  HOLLYWOOD  The Television Academy announced today that it will present Chelsea Clinton with an honorary lifetime achievement award at the 67th Prime Time Emmy Awards in September. The announcement received immediate accolades from an array of Hollywood celebrities who supported Hillary Clinton for president.  Alec Baldwin Tweeted that the special Emmy  was a necessary and important recognition of a woman who has accomplished a whole lot of stuff.  Chelsea Handler was unable to express her elation as she wept uncontrollably in the comforting arms of California Senator Barbara Boxer during an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.  In an interview with Chris Matthews on MSNBC this afternoon, Chelsea Clinton shared her feelings about the honor. Following is a transcript of their conversation that will air tomorrow night at 6:00pm on MSNBC.  CHRIS MATTHEWS: While Donald Trump was in France avoiding impeachment calls here at home, Chelsea Clinton discovered she is going to be honored at this years Emmys with an honorary Lifetime Achievement Award. Shes in the studio with me tonight. Lets play Hardball!  (Show theme song plays)  CHRIS MATTHEWS: Im excited to welcome my first guest tonight, Chelsea Clinton. Daughter of former President Bill Clinton and former first lady, senator, secretary of state and two time presidential loser, Hillary Clinton. Chelsea, thank you for coming.  CHELSEA CLINTON: Thank you, Chris. Its a pleasure to be here. And just for the record, mom may have lost the delegate count but she received over 3 million more popular votes than Donald Trump.  CHRIS MATTHEWS: That is true, but it has nothing to do with how our elections work. She was unfortunately defeated fair and square by Donald Trump eight years after getting shellacked by Barack Obama. Now, lets talk about you. Tell me, what did you think when you heard you were getting an Emmy Award? Must have been exhilarating.  CHELSEA: Yes, it was so exciting. My children and I were reading The Canterbury Tales together when my mom called and broke the news. She was so happy for me.  CHRIS MATTHEWS: How did your dad react?  CHELSEA: Dad has been on a fishing expedition on a secluded island in the Caribbean for the past week. I havent spoken with him yet.  CHRIS MATTHEWS: Oh god  please tell me hes not hanging out with billionaire pedophile Jeffery Epstein again.  CHELSEA: Hes fishing with some family friends, Chris.  CHRIS MATTHEWS: What was the nickname for Epsteins tawdry island of debauchery? Orgy Island! So disgusting. Anyway, lets hope that President Clinton has put all that nonsense behind him. So have you thought about what youre going to say when you accept your Emmy?  CHELSEA: Well, the awards arent until September so I have some time to think it through.  CHRIS MATTHEWS: Ill bet youre gonna pay tribute to your mom, huh?  CHELSEA: Of course I will acknowledge mom, but this is my award. I will probably focus on the important and crucial work that I do with everything from breastfeeding and diarrhea to gender pronoun options.  CHRIS MATTHEWS: But your mom was just humiliated in one of the more remarkable elections in the history of our country. Surely you will have some comforting words for the millions of voters who were so heartbroken with her embarrassing defeat.  CHELSEA: I think voters have accepted that even though mom won more popular votes than Donald Trump they are stuck with him.  CHRIS MATTHEWS: There have been stories about your mom wandering aimlessly in the woods. Is that her way of avoiding your father?  CHELSEA: Why would she avoid my father?  CHRIS MATTHEWS: Well, he might be vacationing on Orgy Island now, but at some point hes going to come back home. And its not like your mom has anything to occupy her time with. I guess what Im asking is, after all the years of what everybody assumes is an acrimonious relationship, can your parents endure residing in the close proximity they now find themselves in?  CHELSEA: My mom and dad love each other and cherish the moments they have together.  CHRIS MATTHEWS: Do you know what youre going to wear at the Emmys?  CHELSEA: I have been so busy working to make the world a better place that I havent even thought about that, Chris.  CHRIS MATTHEWS: I read somewhere that your mom called you selfless. Are you selfless, Chelsea?  CHELSEA: I dont think of myself as selfless. I do sacrifice the majority of my time bettering the lives of millions of people around the world, but thats probably due to my baptist upbringing. Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thy self, Chris.  CHRIS MATTHEWS: Uh huh. Tell me, did your dad ever have relations with a woman of color?  CHELSEA: I assume you are talking about working relationships. Yes, he has and still does have rewarding working relationships with many women of color.  CHRIS MATTHEWS: During the second presidential debate with your mom, Donald Trump brought along three women who for years have claimed your dad sexually assaulted or harassed them. But being victims of sexual misconduct wasnt the only thing those women had in common.  CHELSEA: What are you talking about?  CHRIS MATTHEWS: They were all white women. Not one woman of color. That bothered me at first. But then I realized   CHELSEA: Realized what?  CHRIS MATTHEWS: I realized how much respect your dad has always had for women of color. The first black president wasnt going to sexually abuse his own kind. I have no doubt that you are very proud of that.  CHELSEA: I, uh   CHRIS MATTHEWS: Well look at that  were out of time. Congratulations on your Emmy award Chelsea. And please, give my best to your mom. I can only imagine how deep her devastation must still be. Hopefully your Emmy award will help brighten her dark days.  CHELSEA: Thats it? But we didnt talk about my book!  CHRIS MATTHEWS: (Looking into camera) Coming up next, two men who went to high school with Donald Trump Jr. allege he once said he had to piss like a Russian race horse. Youre watching Hard Ball."

" Al Gore: Global Warming Will Cause Millions of Peoples Heads to Explode http://www.thedailyrash.com/al-gore-global-warming-will-cause-millions-of-peoples-heads-to-explode  NEW YORK   Former Vice President Al Gore issued a joint statement with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) this morning warning that unless drastic measures are taken this year to curb global warming, millions of peoples heads are going to explode. Speaking to U.N. delegates at the One World Economic Forum, Gore said the cumulative effects of drought, famine, global civil wars and eroding national monuments will spark what scientists call homocranialcombustible  or in laymans terms, exploding human heads.  The calamitous effects of global warming will soon begin making peoples heads explode, Gore told reporters afterward. The scientific community has yet to discover exactly how this is going to happen but make no mistake, regardless of what the deniers say, its going to happen unless we act.  After the announcement Gore boarded a private helicopter that transported him to South Hampton, Long Island where he lunched with Barbra Streisand, Dan Rather and Jerry Springer. A few hours later he helicoptered back to mid-town Manhattan where he spoke with Rachel Maddow on MSNBC.  RACHEL MADDOW:  I want to welcome to my show the former vice president, former senator, Nobel Peace Prize recipient, Oscar and Grammy winner and NY Times best selling author, Al Gore.  AL GORE: (touching his heart) A pleasure to be with you, Rachel.  RACHEL MADDOW:  Thats a heck of a resume.  AL GORE: Oh gosh, Im not any better than the insignificant guy on the street, Rachel.  RACHEL MADDOW:  Mr. Vice President, is it true?  AL GORE:  That Im single, wealthy and available?  Thedailyrash.comRACHEL MADDOW:  No, that peoples heads are going to start exploding if we dont act now on global warming.  AL GORE:  Unfortunately, Rachel, its true. If we dont act immediately the world will be engulfed in exploding heads along with the expected famine, World War III and higher intensity allergy symptoms.  RACHEL MADDOW:  But why are our heads going to explode, Mr. Vice President?  AL GORE:  Oh, Rachel, its such a convoluted mixture of everything from CO2 and carbon to industrial waste and bovine flatulence. It would take me weeks to decipher the scientific theorems in a way that you might per chance be able to understand.  RACHEL MADDOW:  What can I do to ensure my head wont explode?  AL GORE:  Rachel, unless we raise the trillions of dollars thats needed to combat this deadly and horrific symptom of climate change, theres nothing you can do.  RACHEL MADDOW:  Thats just horrible, Mr. Vice President.  AL GORE:  Dont you know it.  RACHEL MADDOW: (digging around in her purse) Could I give you some money right now? To do my part?  AL GORE: (whips out a duffel bag) Of course Rachel. And I sure hope everyone on your staff can give me their money too.  (MSNBC staff members crowd around Al Gore throwing money into his duffel bag)  Thedailyrash.comRACHEL MADDOW:  (Into TV camera) I want everyone watching to dig deep into your wallets, look for coins in the cushions of your couch, anything. If you wont do it to keep your own head from exploding, do it for your child, your aging parents or frightened transgenders who dont want to die.  AL GORE: (Grimacing as he tries to squeeze the full duffel bag closed) Rachel, I want to thank you and your staff for this money and I want to remind your audience to give. (looks into camera) Because if we dont immediately raise the money we need, your head is going to explode. I want all you parents out there to think about this: Whats it going to do to the psyche of your little child when one minute theyre sitting at the dinner table picking at their green beans, and the next minute theyre wiping the brains of their mother off their little face?  RACHEL MADDOW:  (gasping) Its just too awful to think about, President Gore.  AL GORE:  (Still struggling to close overstuffed duffel bag) It sure is, Rachel.  After having lunch at a Beverly Hills restaurant with George Clooney and Oprah, President Obama spoke to reporters about the devastating climate change news as he played Go Fish with Rev. Al Sharpton on board Air Force One.  Dont listen to the deniers, the president warned. The science is settled. There is no doubt whatsoever in the minds of the worlds greatest climate change experts that human heads will begin spontaneously exploding if we dont spend trillions of dollars to battle the horrific consequences of man made global warming.  A reporter asked if the president was worried about his daughters.  Oh sure. But Im also worried about the young women out there who look like they could be my daughters.  Speaking to seniors about the advantages of shotgun ownership at the Dark Tunnel of Eternity nursing home in West Virginia, Vice President Biden was asked about global warming induced head explosions.  Thedailyrash.comLook folks, yall are the lucky ones, Biden said. Most of you are gonna be dead before global warming can make your head explode. But God love ya, think about your grandchildren. Even if their little heads arent among the first to explode, there could still be horrific consequences.

Do you think searing fragments of skull flying through the air like shrapnel aint gonna cause some gruesome damage? Even if the skull fragments dont blind your grand kids, imagine how unattractive theyll be for the rest of their lives. Now cmon, get out your wallets and donate.

A former spokesperson for the Ron Paul for President committee fervently denies the candidate distributed LSD.  Representative Paul was not at the Occupy Wall Street protests so how could he have been dispensing LSD to those people?  Yet several protesters claim that Ron Paul not only gave them LSD, but encouraged them to build nuclear weapons at home in their spare time.  That Ron Paul guy was really cool, proclaimed former Columbia University student Dylan Baez Shwartzkoff. Dude gave me and my girlfriend some awesome acid and said if we voted for him hed decriminalize drugs and make them available in schools along with condoms and small firearms.  Other protesters allege Paul told them his administration would not punish anyone for having a nuclear weapon.  Thedailyrash.comYeah, that dude was pretty radical, exclaimed protester Nirvana Tweedsdale. He turned me and my friends on to some awesome LSD and then hung out with us. Mr. Ron gave us pamphlets about constitutional freedoms and surviving nuclear fallout. At one point after the acid had kicked in, Mr. Ron leaned in and whispered: how would you like to have an atom bomb of your very own? I must have been tripping pretty heavy at that point because when I looked at him there was a tiny naked man draped around his shoulders gnawing on a candy apple.  Many protesters who tripped on Ron Pauls LSD said they experienced hallucinations about President Obama.  Thedailyrash.comSkip Boyle, Indianapolis  I saw President Obama sitting on top of a van weeping openly, clutching a tear soaked towel. Then Cloris Leachman flew over me on a big black bird. She had bright blue lips and was shrieking Ron Paul! Ron Paul! down at the crowd. When the bird flew away President Obama began humming Simon and Garfunkels Sounds of Silence and danced slowly with himself as Cloris Leachmans Ron Paul! Ron Paul! echoed faintly from the heavens.  Christin Hemmens, Chicago  I saw President Obama up to his neck in a big stack of pancakes. There was an enormous pat of butter on top of his head. When the butter began to melting down President Obamas face Cloris Leachman flew above us straddling a very large crow screeching, Ron Paul! Ron Paul! It was pretty awesome. Then my arms morphed into German chocolate cake and I began to eat myself.  Thedailyrash.comAbbey Hope, New York  I saw Cloris Leachman fly over the crowd on that bird, but I didnt do any LSD.  Lewis Umbrellahem, New York  That lady on the bird rocked, man!  Bernard Angelopoulos, Carrboro, NC   Ron Paul was radical, bro. He turned me and my friend onto some primo acid and told us if we voted for him we could have a nuclear bomb. Then I saw Burt Bacharach in the bushes having sex with Gladys Knight.  When reached for comment after a speech in Washington last night, Ron Paul said he had no idea what the Wall Street protesters were talking about and denied giving anyone LSD.  Oh, thats all just so much nonsense, he barked as he got into a waiting car."	Satire
" Obama Loses Pickup Game Against Kobe, Takes Out Frustration On White House Staff By Lance Beaudry http://www.sensationalisttimes.com/obama-loses-pickup-game-against-kobe-takes-out-frustration-on-white-house-staff/ WASHINGTON  After taking a beating in a one-on-one game of basketball against Kobe Bryant today, the President shutout every member of the White House Staff in 48 consecutive games of 21. I knew Kobe wasnt going to let me win, Obama said. But after that 21-3 rattling, I made the staff pay, he added smiling. The Los Angeles Lakers were visiting the White House as NBA champions. It was the fifth such visit for Bryant and the 11th for coach Phil Jackson. Six of Jacksons visits were with the Chicago Bulls. It was quite funny to see actually, Jackson said. I heard all these things about the Pres. being a pretty good ball player, but Kobe took him to school. Bryant was pretty pleased with the result, but said he expected to win. It was the left-handed thing that did him in, Bryant said. Hes got no right-side game, so I all I had to do was block him out on the one side and he was toast. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Obama was especially competitive when it came to their one-on-one game. Ive played a few pickup games against Barack before and Ive never seen him like this, Gates said. He was running around like a madman and swearing to himself. I didnt even have to let him win. Gates wasnt the only one to feel Obamas b-ball wrath. I didnt even really want to play, said Pete Rouse, Interim White House Chief of Staff. I dont even like basketball and Im definitely no good at it, but Mr. Obama was insisting that everyone play. While Rouses matchup provided comic relief, todays games showed a different side of the President, a slightly maniacal side. Maybe now the Republicans will see just how much they have in common with him. Who am I kidding?"	Satire
" White House Says Trump in Frequent Contact with Extraterrestrials http://realnewsrightnow.com/2017/09/white-house-says-trump-in-frequent-contact-with-extraterrestrials/ WASHINGTON, D.C.  Since assuming office on January 20, 2017, President Donald J. Trump has periodically exchanged messages with intelligent extraterrestrial life forms who, according to White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, have provided him with advice and guidance on a multitude of issues ranging from job creation to national security. They know hes an excellent negotiator  probably the best our planet has to offer  and thats why theyve elected to speak with him, Secretary Sanders told a handful of reporters during an off-camera briefing on Wednesday. While Sanders could not comment on the extent or frequency of the encounters, she said President Trump is extremely humbled to be the first head of state to make contact with alien life. While senior White House officials and even Trumps immediate family are reportedly barred from attending meetings between the president and his extraterrestrial advisers, sources close to Mr. Trump say the president has hinted that hes negotiating a deal with the aliens that will make America better than anyone ever thought possible. However, due to the secrecy surrounding President Trumps private encounters with the extraterrestrials, the terms and precise nature of the deal remain unclear. During an interview with Fox News host Shepard Smith, President Trumps longtime friend and dentist, Dr. Charles H. Brister, DDS, said the president believes he was chosen by the aliens for a reason. At our last session, [the president] told me how grateful he is to have these beings in his corner, particularly considering how unfairly hes been treated by the media, Dr. Brister said, adding, Hes the only one capable of doing this and he knows it. Thats why the American people elected him. In a statement released Thursday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said that, despite the implications, President Donald J. Trump has not yet met face-to-face with the allegedly intelligent beings. As to whether Mr. Trump will have his own close encounter of the third kind is, according to the White House, between the president and his ET counterparts."	Satire
" Hillary Clinton Hospitalized With Exhaustion After Signing Too Many Books http://realnewsrightnow.com/2017/09/hillary-clinton-hospitalized-exhaustion-signing-many-books/ YONKERS, Ny.  Hillary Clinton was hospitalized with exhaustion on Thursday after the former Secretary of State signed a record-shattering one thousand copies of her new book, What Happened, during a book signing event at a Manhattan area Barnes & Noble. Witnesses say the former Democratic presidential nominee appeared to lose consciousness moments after signing the 1,000th copy of What Happened for a loyal fan. She stood up like she was about to say something and then she kind of staggered backwards before falling face first into a chest-high stack of books, Maria Rodriguez, a lifelong Clinton supporter and mother of six, told The New York Times. Clinton, whose bestselling account of why she lost the 2016 presidential election to former reality TV star and billionaire entrepreneur Donald J. Trump has sold more copies in its first week than The Art of the Deal sold in a year, is said to be recovering at Manhattans Mount Sinai Hospital. Mrs. Clinton suffered some minor bruising but we expect her to make a full recovery, Mount Sinais chief medical officer, Dr. Ben Sheldon, told reporters on Thursday. Rest assured, shell be back to signing books in no time. Sources close to Clinton say that despite her injuries, the former Secretary of State is readier than ever to get on with her book tour. She let her self go a little too hard today, Clintons longtime friend and publicist, Jacob Knot, told Real News Right Now, adding, It just goes to show how devoted she is to the American people. In just over a week since its release, What Happened has quickly become the most talked-about publication in American history with tens of thousands turning out daily to catch a glimpse of the former First Lady turned bestselling author.

President Donald J. Trump, in an appearance on Fox News this week, accused a CNN news crew of stealing his wallet during his 2020 presidential campaign rally in Florida last Saturday. Let me tell you, these people are very dishonest, the President told Shepard Smith on Tuesday. They came to me asking for a soundbite and the next thing  the next thing you know, my wallet is gone. President Trump described the wallet as a brown leather passcase from his own Signature Collection and said at the time of the theft he was carrying it in the right pocket of his sports coat. These people have their own agenda; they cant be trusted. You look at CNN and the fake stories they put out, its sick what these people will do for ratings, Trump charged before adding that the Secret Service is spearheading an investigation into the incident. While refusing to elaborate on the nature of the investigation, President Trump told Fox News he has ordered Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy to personally lead the inquiry into his wallets whereabouts. Believe me, this is very, very serious and were going to get to the bottom of it, Trump vowed. Youre going to start hearing things very soon. The President went on to say that at the time of the alleged theft, the contents of his wallet included a billfold of approximately five thousand dollars in hundred-dollar bills and a copy of the nuclear launch codes. Sources close to President Trump say he rarely ventures out without his Donald J. Trump Signature Collection passcase wallet. Designed for the discerning entrepreneur, the leather wallet features an emboldened gold logo and comes equipped with a bill compartment, three credit card pockets, and ample storage space. A presidential profile piece published by The New York Times on Wednesday provided a brief description of the high-end wallet, saying it contained a pocket-sized photograph of Russian president Vladimir Putin and no cash. Since assuming office just over a month ago, Mr. Trump has embroiled himself in a seemingly endless war with the mainstream media. In a February 17 tweet, the President of the United States announced, The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People! During Saturdays rally at Orlando Melbourne International Airport, Trump doubled down on attacking the dishonest media, telling a crowd of 9,000 enthusiastic supporters that he would speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth."

" President Trump Orders the Execution of Five Turkeys Pardoned by Obama http://realnewsrightnow.com/2017/01/president-trump-orders-execution-five-turkeys-pardoned-obama/ WASHINGTON, D.C.  In another sweeping move aimed at undoing the perceived damage done by the Obama administration, President Donald J. Trump signed an executive order on Tuesday directing the Department of Justice to revoke all sixteen Thanksgiving Day turkey pardons issued by the former president during his eight years in office. After reviewing the decisions made by the previous administration, President Trump has determined that a number of turkey pardons issued by Barack Obama were done so in a manner that was both deceitful and hazardous to the American people, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer announced on Tuesday. This morning, the president once again used his executive powers to see to it that justice is served and that the surviving creatures will be destroyed. Spicer said very little is known about the true origins of the sixteen turkeys or why they were specifically singled out by former President Barack Obama. There are a lot of obvious questions we just dont have the answers to. Were they connected to radical Islamic terrorism? Black Lives Matter extremists? We cant be sure, he said. All we know is they were sentenced to death and Obama took it upon himself to meddle in the independent judicial process. Of the sixteen turkeys pardoned by Obama, all but five are deceased. These birds, despite their deaths, will have their pardons revoked posthumously during a ceremony in the Rose Garden, Secretary Spicer explained. The remaining birds  Tater, Tot, Abe, Honest, and Cheese  are scheduled to be remanded into federal custody on Friday before they are turned over to officials from the Federal Bureau of Prisons who are under orders to execute the turkeys by firing squad. The annual Thanksgiving Day turkey pardon dates back to 1863 when President Abraham Lincoln first granted clemency to his sons beloved pet turkey which the First Family had intended to feast on for Thanksgiving dinner."

" Sen. Chuck Grassley Opens Corruption Investigation Into Hillary Clinton http://dailyheadlines.net/2017/06/sen-chuck-grassley-opens-corruption-investigation-into-hillary-clinton/ The democrats are about to pay for their false Trump/Russia narrative.  Democrats know there is no there there, but want their voters to think otherwise.  And theyre right.  59% of democrats believe that Russia actually changed the votes in order for Trump to win.  This just proves they are utter morons because voting machines arent connected to the internet. Sen Chuck Grassley on the other hand is going after Hillary for corruption and black mail.  Witnesses who actually allow their names to be used have already gone public with Clintons scheme to save a donor to the Clinton Foundation from prison for embezzlement. Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley has started an investigation into whether Hillary Clinton acted to prevent a Bangladeshi probe into a Clinton Foundation donor, The Daily Caller reports. Grassley, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, sent a letter to the State Department requesting information regarding possible interference into a corruption investigation into Muhammad Yunus, a Bangladeshi banker and economist who is also a close friend of the Clintons. In May, The Daily Caller reported that during her time at the State Department, Clinton had put pressure on Bangladesh to stop a probe into Yunus and Grameen Bank. The son of Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina even told The Daily Caller he had been threatened with an IRS audit if the investigation was not dropped. As I wrote in my August 2016 letter to Department of Justice, federal law requires that executive branch employees be disqualified from matters that have a direct and predictable effect on the employees own financial interests or the financial interests of those persons or organizations with which the employee is affiliated, such as those of a spouse, unless the employee first obtains an individual waiver or a regulatory exemption applies, Grassley said in a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Once again, Secretary Clintons actions have raised reasonable suspicions that she violated these rules and undermined the publics confidence in the integrity of the State Department. If the Secretary of State used her position to intervene in an independent investigation by a sovereign government simply because of a personal and financial relationship stemming from the Clinton Foundation rather than the legitimate foreign policy interests of the United States, then that would be unacceptable, he added. Co-mingling her official position as Secretary of State with her family foundation would be similarly inappropriate. It is vital to determine whether the State Department had any role in the threat of an IRS audit against the son of the Prime Minister in retaliation for this investigation. If Grassley continues his look into the Grameen Bank affair, it would be the first major post-election congressional inquiry into either the Democrat presidential nominee or the Clinton Foundation."

Something with which he appears to be unfamiliar. I think its important for him to try and understand that were not so different, him and us. Although we dont communicate by shouting and threatening each other. Well, apart from that pub  The Setting Moon  on the estate in Harlow.

Theyve gotta go folks, theyve gotta go, said Trump, at another pointless rally for cunts. Anybody who suggests that America isnt an amazing country or needs improving in any way shouldnt be holding a high-profile position like that. I dont see any irony in saying that while also peddling slogans like drain the swamp or make America great again, no irony whatsoever, no sir. Anyway, to business, America sucks right now. Who agrees? A source close to Trump said, yeah, yeah, I know. Im just kind of weary at this stage, to be honest. Nothing is dreadful anymore because Im numb to it, as are most of you at this stage, no doubt. We did ask Donald to read the constitution but he just laughed and told us to shove it up our asses, which again was like water off a ducks back at this stage. We all deserve the nuclear holocaust that awaits us, and I welcome it."	Satire
" Americas bums furious at comparisons to Donald Trump http://newsthump.com/2017/09/23/americas-bums-furious-at-comparisons-to-donald-trump/ Bums across America have lashed out after Lebron James likened them to Donald Trump. After the basketball player criticised the president for one of the many ridiculous things hes done today, bums have insisted the comparison is unfair. Street resident Chuck Williams told us, Our lives are hard enough as it is without people thinking we share personality traits with that asshole. I get that us vagrants get called bums, but really what have we ever done to deserve being put in the same bracket as the septuagenarian Cheeto in the White House? Sure, I do a little begging every now and again, but at least Im open about where my money comes from  you can look at my tax returns anytime you like. But Ive never complimented the far-right, never grabbed a pussy, never reduced international diplomacy to a playground tantrum, never tried to implement illegal immigration policies, never colluded with a foreign power and never used a national platform to massage my own ego ahead of helping Americans that need assistance. Surely I should get a pass? When asked for comment, Lebron James apologised to bums everywhere, and told reporters, I shouldnt have said bum, I should have said Think-skinned moron, or idiotic man-child, or maybe self-publicising imbecile. Sorry about that."	Satire
" North Korea changes national anthem to Elton Johns Rocket Man http://newsthump.com/2017/09/20/north-korea-changes-national-anthem-to-elton-johns-rocket-man/ North Korea has a new national anthem, and its a catchy one, it has emerged today. Second craziest world leader Kim Jong-un announced the change via state-operated news organisation DPRK News this morning. He proclaimed, Citizens of this glorious country, our national anthem will today be changed to a good little tune I stumbled across, quite by chance and in no way related to a recent speech at the UN, called Rocket Man. I have heard some rumours that the people of our glorious land are spreading lies and falsehoods about me. And I feel some of you may have got the wrong impression of me from the mass starvation, suppression of the media and the authoritarian rule and that sort of thing. Hopefully this will help you understand me better. Its part of my job, you see, to pour money into our missile programme. Im worried that its gonna be a long, long time, but I hope that one day youll find Im not the man you think I am at home. He clarified Oh, no no no, I AM a rocket man  but Im actually quite a nice guy, too. So I hope this anthem will draw us all together as we face the ongoing threats from the unhinged maniac in the White House. US President Donald Trump has yet to respond to the news, as he is reportedly very busy looking at the footage of his UN speech and counting the number of people present so he can quadruple it before boasting of his crowd size on Twitter later today."

" Ohio Gov. John Kasich Legalizes Exhumation of Confederate Soldiers Statewide https://www.delawareohionews.com/national-news/ohio-governor-kasich-exhuming-confederate-soldiers/ By Ricardo Paye 69784 69 A small Ohio town that exhumed the bodies of Confederate soldiers and discarded their remains in a dirty lake has inspired Ohio Governor John Kasich to enact legislation allowing other cemeteries to do the same. He signed an executive order this morning waiving the protections granted to the graves and memorials of Confederate veterans in the state.  Speaking out against Confederate monuments  We owe a great deal of gratitude to history and the brave men and women who have fought and died to make this great country what it is today, read a statement released by the governors office. However, we are a divided people. Gone is the nation that looked past its racist, violent history in favor of that warm tale where everyone was equal and the future was bright.     Confederate monuments in public spaces are nothing more than grotesque reminders of the fake news that once threatened our great republic, and which threatens us again today. Lets leave memories of the Confederacy where they belong  on the internet  and reclaim this great land for more righteous mistakes and tragedies yet to come, the statement concluded.  A state governor supporting the desecration of veteran graves is a highly controversial escalation in the nationwide debate over the place Confederate statues and memorials have in contemporary American society. A white nationalist rally that turned violent in Charlottesville, Virginia on August 12th brought renewed attention to the divisive issue and led cities across the country to remove Confederate monuments.  Kasich positioning for 2020 presidential bid  Beyond inflaming an already sensitive debate, Kasichs decision to support removal of confederate memorials while also embracing the concept of fake news is a clear political maneuver aimed at drawing support from Trump opponents while also chipping away at the presidents base, which stood by him last week when he questioned whether removing confederate monuments has gone too far.  This is Governor Kasich preparing for the 2020 presidential election, said Ohio Republican Strategist Dennis Lovell. He doesnt care about dusty Confederate grave sites. Allowing cemeteries to dig up and sexually molest the remains of confederate soldiers is clearly a polarizing move, sure, but the governor is banking on the majority of Americans favoring unity and being done with Trump come the next election, and he wants to be remembered as a leader willing to take the radical steps necessary to bring this country back together.  Activists take bizarre liberties with Confederate corpses  In Delaware, Ohio, where the controversial #exhumeconfederates grave digging movement started last week when government officials sanctioned the exhumation of Confederate soldiers, its been reported that the skeletal remains of several bodies were used as props in public sex acts performed by a group of ANTIFA protesters camping on the property.  Kasichs order ensures cemeteries wont face legal repercussions for exhuming confederate remains, but says nothing about how the bodies must be handled or discarded, opening the door to more bizarre forms of desecration.  Joseph Diggins, an employee at the cemetery, was tasked with exhuming some of the bodies and corroborated a number of troubling reports.  We were trying to dig everyone up and get them dumped in the lake without drawing much attention, but the anti-Trump crowd picked up our scent from their tents and rushed over to snatch a couple of the caskets, Diggins explained. The remains were obviously fragile and that led one group to crush a skull on the pavement and smoke the powder out of crystal meth pipe they were passing around.  Trump, Kasich have opposing views on desecration of Confederate graves  Governor Kasich has not commented on the troubling reports or offered a strategy for preventing further depravity as hundreds of state cemeteries begin exhuming their Confederate dead.  The governor has spoken out against Trumps position, however, tweeting he was disappointed by the Phoenix speech where the president condemned those digging up dead bodies.   Trump asked Americans to stop disturbing Confederate grave sites.  Folks, our Confederate soldiers should remain buried in the ground, OK? Government officials, protesters, whoever  they shouldnt be mining Confederate bone dust or molesting corpses. Leave the bones alone. Thats what Im telling everyone. I speak to a lot of important people, and I say, Leave the bones alone, said Trump at the rally. They fought for America. They were buried in some of Americas finest coffins, by the way  wood that was actually luxurious for a dead body, not those cheap egg carton coffins Chinas making today  and now, what, were digging them up and wasting all that wood? I could probably build one of the finest properties in the world with that wood  maybe a little steel, too; Id need maybe a little, maybe a little  but no, no, these people? No values. No business sense. They probably wont even sell the uniforms. Id sell the uniforms. I dont know. It has to stop.  The president also took his concerns to Twitter the following day, speaking out against Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz), who he called weak on grave digging. There was no response to Governor Kasichs criticisms or plans for executive action.  President Donald Trump's tweet on grave digging  Both sides brace for extended grassroots protests  While the political maneuvering continues, right wing activists and white nationalists are preparing to mobilize across the state of Ohio, hoping to halt or at least slow down the destruction of confederate corpses.  It goes without saying that desecrating veteran graves is taking things a little too far, said Ruth Ballman, the leader of Ohio white nationalist group The Pink Panthers. If our Republican governor thinks he can turn his back on his people like this and not find a thousand rotting slave corpses hanging at the statehouse, he has another thing coming. Were ready to dig our way back to the 19th century if thats what this governor wants.  On the left, ANTIFA gypsies admitted theyre mostly looking forward to the increase in Confederate bone powder, which is believed by many to be a mind-altering substance that intensifies ones positions on racism, morality, history, and reality.  Were going to snort these bones up and probably just kill each other, said a leftist activist camping out at one Columbus cemetery. Fuck it.

Police responded and arrested the man for not shutting his god damn mouth.  34 people overdosed on heroin at a block party held on Lincoln Avenue over the weekend in the Northwest Neighborhood. Firefighters and EMS responded but gave up after reviving 5 people only to see them overdose again several minutes later. Everybody died.

" Solar Saloon Will Become Gay Bar https://www.delawareohionews.com/local-news/solar-saloon-gay-bar/ By Ricardo Paye 13068 Downtown Delaware, Ohio watering hole The Solar Saloon has announced it will convert to a gay bar sometime this fall.  The move comes after the recent Solar Gate controversy threatened to ruin the existing establishment, according to sources close to the bar. Hundreds of negative reviews and the #SolarGate hashtag emerged on social media this week after the bars owner, Ron Limpledick, allegedly directed racist and homophobic remarks toward a customer.      Limpledick denies the claims and says the decision to become a gay bar proves he isnt prejudiced.  Gays, slants, spooks  I love everybody, Limpledick said. Im re-opening the Saloon as a gay bar so that theres a safe, inclusive place for all of these outcasts to gather regardless of their inferior race or sexual orientation.  According to reviews and reports from those at the bar the night of the incident, Limpledick called an African American customer a Fancy nigger fuck boy after the man ordered a Gin and Tonic.  It was strange, said Jan Marvula, who witnessed the interaction. Racist and offensive, but said in kind of a sultry voice, like he was flirting. Beyond shivering a little bit and experiencing an intense urge to flee the establishment, I wasnt sure what to make of it.  Limpledick confirms he was sexually aroused but says the comment was taken out of context.  It was a question, Limpledick said. I was asking him if he was gay. Im not, by the wayyou know, not officiallybut if he were I was going to try selling him one of our new solar powered penis pumps.  Limpledick says more solar powered sex toys will be sold as part of the bars transition.  The alleged victim, Yung Custodian, said he forgives Limpledick and hopes he gets help.  He once asked to photograph my dick on a solar panel and I said no because Im straight. Hes been an asshole ever since, Custodian said. Last week he said he was working on a solar powered time machine that would take us back to 1808 where hed make me work as his gay slave or some shit. I hope he finds Christ.  ***UPDATE***  To support the victim of this bigotry and interact with others exposed to pre-gay bar Solar Saloon, please join and follow the Dom Fisher Fan Club on Facebook. #domfisherfanclub  Image courtesy of Steve Baker on Flickr "	Satire
" 6 Safe Places to Overdose on Heroin in Delaware, Ohio https://www.delawareohionews.com/drugs-rec/safest-places-to-overdose-on-heroin-in-delaware-ohio/ By Ricardo Paye 37700 17 Lets face it, theres nothing you can do about your heroin addiction. You can, however, limit the risk of death when you accidentally (and inevitably) overdose. One way to do that is to shoot up in safe, public places that are close to medical intervention but off law enforcements radar.  This list, compiled by Delaware Ohio News in collaboration with local junkies, provides the 6 safest places to overdose in Delaware based on two safety factors: The likelihood of being saved and the likelihood of being arrested. Spots with low risk of arrest and high likelihood of medical intervention are the ones that topped our list.     So, without further ado, lets review the top 6 places to get smacked and narrowly avoid your untimely demise.  6. The Blue Tube Slide at Mingo Park  Tube Slide at Mingo Park in Delaware, Ohio  The blue tube slide at Mingo Park is great because it provides a unique and even tranquil setting for mainlining your way into the dark abyss. Its safe because there will eventually be children trying to use the slide, meaning youll be found sooner than later. The risk of arrest is lower here given law enforcements desire to avoid traumatizing kids and families more than they have to. Watching you foam at the mouth and come back to life among a swarm of first responders is enough for one day.  5. Zion United Church of Christ  Zion United Church of Christ Delaware, Ohio  This place of worship provides excellent cover for heroin addicts thanks to their community shelter. Church officials have said they expect heroin addicts to use the facility and staff the location with off duty police and paramedics. What better place to have your soul temporarily leave your body? You can briefly find God and then fall back to reality in the arms of His righteous servants before getting dope sick and chasing the dragon all over again.  4. Anywhere in the Northwest Neighborhood  Northwest Neighborhood in Delaware, Ohio  Considered the heart of soul of Delaware, Ohio, the Northwest Neighborhood is a historic district that was home to city founders and entrepreneurs in the 1800s. Today, its a liberal and intellectual stronghold with a strong sense of community and a dense population of sympathetic families. Fiends can stumble their way through these tree lined streets and never be more than a few feet away from a warm, welcoming family just waiting to nurse them back to health and call 911. If cops associate you with the respectable neighborhood, theyre more likely to let you off with a warning.  3. Carlisle Elementary School  Carlisle Elementary School in Delaware, Ohio  One could argue that any of Delawares five elementary schools would make good spots for drug overdoses, but none is safer than Carlisle. The school is close to Grady Memorial Hospital (#2 on our list) and has a comfortable recycling dumpster to rest against while you pump your veins full of skag from a dirty needle and doze off into oblivion. Dispose of your kit in the recycling bin prior to nodding off and youll be safe from arrest.  2. The Bus Stop at Grady Memorial Hospital  Bus Stop at Grady Memorial Hospital in Delaware, Ohio  The bus stop at Grady Memorial Hospital is safe AND convenient. The local transit authority stop provides reliable transportation and the close proximity to the hospital ensures youre only a few feet away from help when you overdose and begin seizing for your life.  1. The Gazebo at Bicentennial Park (Behind the Fire Station)  Bicentennial Park and Wilbur Bills Fire Station in Delaware, Ohio  Topping our list is the shaded Gazebo at Bicentennial Park, conveniently located directly behind the main fire station in the City of Delaware. This spot is perfect for obvious reasons. Its discreet enough to remain hidden from plain view of the surrounding roadways and Wesleyan campus; it provides a peaceful seating area with cover from the elements; and its right next to the people who will save your life when you take it too far and almost kill yourself.  Its so close, in fact, that its rumored a paramedic once used a blowgun to shoot a Narcan dart over 100 yards, striking and reviving an overdose victim without even leaving the station.  So there you have it: The safest places to overdose in Delaware, Ohio. Share with the addict in your life and do your part to help prolong their death. "	Satire

" Trumps Health Deteriorates as White House Pressures Mount https://www.ncscooper.com/trumps-health-deteriorates-as-white-house-pressures-mount/ Washington, D.C.  Washington insiders and health officials close to Donald Trump have raised concerns that the 45th President is showing signs of aggressive aging after only being office for 152 days, 8 hours, 9 minutes and 7 seconds. According to more than one White House aide, all of whom chose to remain anonymous, the 71-year-old leader of the free world has dramatically aged at a breathtaking pace. There are concerns about Trumps health as the pressures of the presidency take their toll on him. When he took office, lets be honest, he was no spring chicken, said one White House insider who spoke on condition of anonymity, but it seems like hes aged a decade or more in just the past few months. Everyone is very concerned about him and even his physician has told him to cut back on his daily tasks. Maybe he should go to Mar-a-Lago more than once a week, you know? According to aging experts, this is exactly the kind of effect stress and anger have on the human body. Well just look at him and you can see that hes not doing well, said anti-aging specialist and occasional CNN commentator Dr. Saka Ramanathanana. Obviously this Russian situation and the fact that he hasnt signed one bill from Congress is weighing on him greatly. At this pace, he will not be able to stay in office much longer unless he takes some aggressive self-care actions. Even foreign leaders have noticed the effects of the Oval Office on Trump. During a recent meeting with Egyptian President, Mr. Abdel Fattah Al Sisi commented to the President that he should take it easy. Yes, the road to getting control of your country can take years, said President Fattah Al Sisi in comments he made when questioned about Trumps health in Cairo. Hes trying to do too much too fast and it shows. Hes certainly doing all the right things, like marginalizing the press and threatening minorities and all that kind of stuff, but he needs to better pace himself or he wont gain the control and power he needs to get his agenda done. The question of President Trumps health came up during the daily press brief, which Secretary Sean Spicer dismissed as another fabrication of the liberal media. Look, you guys like to make stories up to fill the news cycle, said Spicer answer a question from ABC News Ann Compton. The President is working hard for the American people, putting them back to work and strengthening our country. Theres no there, there like always. Despite these health concerns, the President is not letting up. He has scheduled rallies around the country to discuss how well hes doing, as well as his first campaign fund-raiser next week for the next 2020 Presidential race, which he assumes will be against Hillary Clinton."

" Trump Cuts NASA After Discovering Moon Not Made Of Cheese https://www.ncscooper.com/trump-cuts-nasa-after-discovering-moon-not-made-of-cheese/ Washington D.C.  Trump Advisers today released official notice that space program NASA is losing all federal funding after the president was told by his second chief of staff, John Kelly in a frustratingly stupid argument with a simple man that the moon was not made of cheese like he was told as a young boy. Kelly was brought on July 31st to the White House to bring order and peace to the chaos of the Russian collusion case, and the day to day bumbling about of the new White House staff. With confusing public relations with the Charlottesville protests and his slowly degrading reputation in D.C. Kelly has been having a difficult time keeping up with the latest fire he has been tasked to put out and has been overheard arguing with the president over certain procedures and sometimes silly things like what the moon is made out of. One employee, who wishes to remain anonymous and is working closely with Kelly told us, The president? I mean hes alright I guess. [Kelly] thinks hes a simpleton, has to over-explain everything to him, like a kid you know? I could have sworn I heard the two of them goin on about how Santa Claus was a fairy tale and not really a guy in a suit that brings you presents every year. Trump eventually put his fingers in his ears and started yelling fake news over and over again so that he couldnt hear [Kelly] and they both let it go after that. NASA has been a wonderful, and highly educational factor of American Society since its foundation in 1946. Pushing the boundaries of exploration in the name of science and progress, NASA is currently working on various projects ranging from the Curiosity Mars Rover to the projects the men and women perform on the International Space Station. American Astronauts at the ISS upon learning that they will be coming back home much sooner than expected are going to be missed by their international team, and have this message to give to America, Citizens of the USA, stand up for your rights now more than ever. The man in charge is not very bright, and while the rest of the world is going to move on he is going to keep you, the United States behind. Dont let one man ruin generations of hard work.

" Russian Space Agency Leaks Flat Earth Photograph https://www.ncscooper.com/russian-space-agency-leak-flat-earth-photograph/ Moscow, Russia  Late this week, the official Russian news agency TASS accidentally released photograph from Roscosmos which seemed to show that the Earth is flat. The picture was taken during a recent Russian restocking flight for the International Space Station when Cosmonaut Sergei Sokolov was performing a routine spacewalk to examine the fuel storage on the exterior of the vessel. American Astronaut Jim Selves, of Topeka, Kansas photographed the Russian through a portal window. Roscosmos, which is the Russian Space Agency, denied the photograph was real and blamed the American fake news media for propagating a false narrative This another untrue assertion by the American fake media to make the Russian Federation look bad, said Roscosmos spokeswoman Vetkhany Millbrigt during a press conference early Friday morning. Although we should remain skeptical about the world around us, Ive spoken with Cosmonaut Sokolov personally and he has no recollection of any spacewalk or a photograph. The photograph was first circulated by CNN, during The Situation Room hosted by Wolf Blitzer, but was soon picked up by other mainstream media outlets. The popular debunking site Snopes.com has yet to discuss the issue. In the modern era, the availability of communications technology and social media like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter have made it easy for individuals, famous and not, to spread disinformation and attract others to their erroneous ideas. One of the topics that have flourished in this environment is that of the Flat-Earth. The solar eclipse of August 21, 2017, gave rise to numerous YouTube videos purporting to show how the details of the eclipse prove the earth is flat. In 2017, the Tunisian and Arab scientific and educational world had a scandal when a Ph.D. student submitted a thesis declaring Earth to be flat, unmoving, young (only 13,500 years of age), and the center of the universe. CNN has denied that it is false information and that the photograph was mentioned last year in the infamous dossier which also mentions then-candidate Donald Trumps run-ins with Russian prostitutes, implying that the flat earth photograph and the yet-to-be-seen pee-pee video are somehow linked."

" President Trump Pauses to Honor the Victims of 7/11 https://www.ncscooper.com/president-trump-pauses-to-honor-the-victims-of-711/ Washington, D.C.  This morning, President Donald Trump and Secondary First Lady Melania Trump took time out of their schedules to honor victims of what the president called one of the worstest, bigliest sad moments in American history. Standing in front of a convenience store just a few blocks away from the White House, President Trump laid a wreath of flowers and paper coffee cups in front of the store. He solemnly placed his hand over his heart as he asked Melania to get out her smartphone and play the country song. Mrs. Trump did as she was asked, and the National Anthem began playing from the phone. After it was finished, Trump gave a few remarks. You know, when I became president, Trump began, everyone said that honoring those who fell on that fateful day 16 years ago would be the toughest and most rewarding experience in the first year of my administration. And they were not wrong. Trump said he would never forget the day the attacks, which were the reason for the ceremony he was holding, took place. I was watching TV in my Trump Tower apartment, Trump told those gathered, and I remember seeing that we had been attacked. Then, and Ill never forget this, I saw probably sixteen or seventeen thousand Muslims dancing and cheering in the streets! In America! From my balcony, no less! At one point, it became clear that Trump may have been a bit confused. The one thing I wasnt sure of, Trump said, was whether it was just the one 7/11 that was attacked, or if it was a coordinated attack. It really bothered me, not knowing, so when I was sworn in, the first thing I did was instruct my staff to gather all the intelligence, all the classified and unclassified information we have on the attacks, and bring it to me so that I could study it. Trump said he was surprised and shocked to find out that none of the intelligence he saw pointed to a Slurpee conspiracy. And none of the information he was provided gave clues to figuring out if a Big Gulp cabal was used, or if the terrorists who perpetrated the attack bought any of those weird hot dog things they sell there. I know what I know, and I know what I saw, Trump said, on that day well all never forget. But yet, nothing that I was given had anything to do with 7-11 convenience stores. What the fuck? What is this, some kind of satirical news story just written to justify a joke about how dumb I am in real life, and the satirist ran out of steam halfway through this paragraph and now hes just literally typing in a stream of consciousness way, just letting whatever dumb shit hits his brain get out there without any filter? Well, in that regard hed be acting just like me, wouldnt he? So did he just Inception this shit? Whos speaking right now? Me, or him? Oh fuck it, Im going to go in there and buy sixteen rolled taco meat things and jam in them all in my mouth at once because life is a sad, cold, dark void."	Satire
" New White House Communication Director Caught with His Hand in a Mooch https://www.ncscooper.com/new-white-house-communication-director-caught-with-his-hand-in-a-mooch/ Air Force One  A White House pool photograph snapped a controversial picture of staffers on a flight to a campaign-style Trump rally in Wisconsin earlier this week. Trump Communication Director Anthony The Mooch Scaramucci was photographed grabbing a quick feel up newly appointed Press Secretarys Sarah Huckabee Sanders dress. I dont even think he was aware he was doing it, said Associated Press pool photographer Heather Kendall who snapped the unfortunate picture. I mean, they were huddled on a small couch in the planes executive lounge and I said hold it and they all posed. But as soon as I said that, Scaramucci shoved his hand up Secretary Huckabees dress and grabbed her by, well, you know. Anthony Scaramucci has been criticized for not only mimicking President Trump in his mannerisms but also copying Mr. Trumps words verbatim. In fact, the new Communications Director seems to parrot the Presidents speeches frequently when being interviewed by the media. However, some say this latest foul is taking being Trump over the line. The picture sent outrage through the liberal blogs and triggered many anti-Trump protests. What the $#@!

I mean, theyre not just talking about it, theyre doing it right in front of the cameras now. This is totally disgusting and offensive. When asked about the photograph during the daily press brief, Secretary Huckabee Sanders downplayed what is now being called Gabbing by the Mooch. This is totally been blown out of proportion, said Ms. Huckabee Sanders taking a question from ABC News. The media likes to blow things up like this. Clearly, its not what you are saying. Mr. Scaramucci is just a little grabby, like most men. Locker room stuff and there was nothing improper about what he did. He does it all the time. He did the other day to Kellyanne and she loved the attention. There has been no comment from the President. When asked during a ceremony today honoring Confederate losses during the Civil War, the President said, Could you be any ruder interrupting this?"	Satire

This also makes Barron the head of the investigation into his fathers alleged links to Russia. I have total faith in Barrons abilities, explained President Trump at the new directors official swearing-in ceremony in Washington D.C. After all, hes got great genes. He will lead an independent investigation. He wont make any allowances for his daddy, who, by the way, can cut his pocket money by a couple hundred thousand bucks any time a certain someone feels the need to poke his nose in some place. Barron Trump is the third member of President Trumps family to occupy a high-ranking government post, after the Presidents daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner. The 11 year old is to be relatively free to carry out his duties independently. According to inside sources, several of his school friends and a Hulk action figure are already tipped for top jobs in the FBI. The FBIs cryptography department is now due to be converted to specialise exclusively in developing cheats and hacks for difficult computer games. Meanwhile, Barron Trump seems to be taking his new job very seriously. Even before he had been sworn in, the FBI arrested his former maths teacher Karen Saltzman on his instruction.

Now, in an exclusive interview with The Postillon, he faces the big questions surrounding this historic move in person.  Postillon: President Trump, thank you for finding the time for this interview. Trump (lighting a cigar): Yeah, I dont usually like to do interviews. Fake news everywhere! Im sure you know that. You seem serious though. Do you mind if I smoke? Postillon: Yes.  Trump: Well Im smoking anyway. Make America great again! Postillon: [Coughs] Lets get right to the point: yesterday you shocked the world by announcing that you were pulling out of the Paris climate agreement. What led you to that monumental decision? Trump: Yeah, it was a big decision. Maybe the biggest ever. Almost as big as my election victory in November. They all said it was impossible, Crooked Hillary was gonna win. But then I won the greatest victory in history. The greatest! Postillon: Mm yes. Congratulations once again. But getting back to the climate agreement: why do you want to withdraw your country from the agreement?  Trump: Global warming. How long will it take for the US to feel serious effects? These eggheads, what are they called again? Oh yeah, scientists. Anyway, they say that itll be really bad in 15 or 20 years. Im 70 now and in 10 years tops Ill be dead anyway, embalmed and lying in my gold mausoleum in Washington D. C. Why would I care about the climate? Postillon: And your children? They have to continue to live on this planet after you.  Trump: Ah, theyre rich. Theyll be fine. Ivanka, for example, is smart, rich and very sexy, too. The dream woman if you ask me. The planet cant possibly get as hot as her. Postillon: Okay what did you dislike so much about the Paris agreement? Your predecessor Barack Obama made sure it was kept very vague and didnt contain any real consequences for polluters. Trump: Well, to start with, the agreement was very unfair to the USA. At least, thats what Steve Bannon and someone on FOX News told me. Also, why would I care about the climate in Paris? I might have reacted differently if it was the Pittsburgh climate agreement. Aside from that, one of my most important goals is to reverse everything that was put into place by this Obama [spits on the floor in disgust]. And: make America great again!  Postillon: Yesbut what consequences will this have exactly? Will the USA continue to try and reduce carbon emissions regardless?  Trump: We will do the opposite! We want to at least triple our carbon emissions by 2020, maybe even double them! No President before me has ever achieved that. We will do everything possible to reach this ambitious goal. We will convert our electric chairs to use combustion engines and wind turbines will turn backwards and consume electricity. If necessary, we will build factories which dont even make anything. Theyll just burn trees and produce smoke. And that even has the side effect of generating jobs.  Postillon: Butthat would be pretty harmful to the climate... Trump: Thats nonsense. Climate schlimate. I cant understand why everyone is whinging again. We can do what we want with our American air. If other countries want to keep their own air clean, please, go ahead. Im not stopping you. Anyway, if the Earth warms up, I wont have to go to Mar-a-Lago as often, I can just stay in tropical Washington D. C.  Postillon: The USA is now on a level with Syria and Nicaragua, the only countries to have spoken out against the agreement. Does that worry you? Trump: Syria made a good choice not to take part. After all, lots of carbon dioxide is released when we bomb it. And what on earth is Nicaragua? Is that something to do with the N-word? Postillon: Nicaragua is a country in Central America.  Trump: I know what Nicaragua is! Youre not very polite. Make America great again!  Postillon: What is your response to those people who say that withdrawing from the agreement will not be an advantage to the US economy? Instead the US will be economically left behind by the rest of the world. Trump: Make America great again! Postillon: Thats not really an answer to the que...  Trump (louder): MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Postillon: Oh, okay, well, thank you for the interv... Trump (shouting): MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!"	Satire
" Trump disgusted that French copied tower from Paris Las Vegas Hotel http://www.the-postillon.com/2017/07/trump-disgusted-about-french-copy.html#more Paris (dpo) - Scandal takes hold of Donald Trumps trip to France. On a visit to the capital, the President of the United States became enraged that the French had shamelessly copied the tower of the famous Paris Las Vegas Hotel in Nevada, USA. President Trump explained that he is fighting back against other nations simply appropriating symbols of American culture in this way.  The President was already taken aback when he learned that the French capital was also called Paris, just like the famous hotel in Las Vegas. At that stage, it could still have been a coincidence, opined Trump. Its a pretty popular name. Paris Hiltons called Paris, too. However, when he observed the distinctive shape of the tower, the brazen conterfeit could not be mistaken: I know a cheap copy when I see one! the US President is reported to have told French President, Emmanuel Macron, in his fury. That is practically an exact copy of the Paris Las Vegas tower! And I know a thing or two about hotels and casinos. An angered Trump was not about to accept any objections from his host, Emmanuel Macron, either. He had the audacity to claim that it was completely the other way around! As if the greatest country in the world would need to copy from anyone else! In fact, half the world is in the business of copying American landmarks. I hear there are several buildings in Egypt that are just poor-quality copies of the famous Luxor Casino in Las Vegas and in China there are even several whole cities that look just like Chinatown in New York. President Trump explained that he would work to ensure that these impudent counterfeiters either demolish their replicas or pay royalties to the USA. Otherwise, he fears the French may also one day build a copy of the Statue of Liberty."	Satire
" Peace offering? Trump sends Comey a delicious cake shortly prior to hearing http://www.the-postillon.com/2017/06/peace-offering-from-trump.html#more Washington (dpo) - A gesture of reconciliation  a short while before former FBI Director James Comeys hearing, a courier arrived for him with a tasty chocolate cake from US President Donald Trump. The cake was beautifully decorated using green sprinkles with a chemical aroma. Comeys secretary Amber Smith confirmed the cake had been received, along with a short note from the President. The note reads: A token of my appreciation for your tireless fight for justice and a sign of my respect for you. You should eat it before your hearing today; itll be great fuel. For optimum results, at least 60 min beforehand so you dont feel bloated at a crucial moment. Best wishes, Donald Trump (tehehe) According to Smith, it is uncertain exactly what kind of cake this is. It appears to be a chocolate cake but I have no idea what the green sprinkles are made of. Perhaps theyre pistachio or mint flavour. Smith continued, explaining that, unfortunately, Mr Comey was unable to eat the cake. He was very pleased to receive such a lovely gift but, just as he was about to cut himself a piece, he suddenly spotted three dead flies lying on it so he had to throw it away. Its a shame about the chocolate, though."	Satire
" Trump converts White House to run entirely on coal http://www.the-postillon.com/2017/06/white-house-to-run-on-coal.html#more Washington (dpo) - That man does nothing by half measures. On Friday President Donald Trump announced the USAs withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement and today news has already surfaced that the power supply to the White House has been entirely converted to run on fossil fuels. White House spokesperson Sean Spicer announced the conversion at a press conference strewn with billowing smoke. The President is leading by example, yelled Spicer over the noise of the generators. Coughing, he continued, from now on, the White House will run exclusively on the energy of the future. Central heating and hot water will be heated by coal fired power stations and a miniature lignite fired power station will provide the electricity supply. At times of short supply, 38 diesel generators can provide additional power. Experts believe that the fast growing levels of soot will soon require the White House to be renamed the Gray House. Figures were already available showing that energy consumption at the White House have increased by 200% since Trump took office. According to a statement from the White House, this is because, the President doesnt like it too hot or too cold so the central heating and air conditioning system are both permanently running at full capacity. According to Spicer, the Trump governments medium term goal is to put in place targeted measures to foster non-renewable energies so that by 2020, all American households are supplied in a similar manner. Now youll have to excuse me, said Sean Spicer in closing, I have to go and shovel 73 wheelbarrows of coal for this evening. The President likes to take hot baths."	Satire
" Iraq War Veteran Dies Trying to Protect Buffet Ice Cream Machine from Obese Woman http://newsmutiny.com/pages/Local/VetsLastStand.htm Home just eight weeks after being wounded during his second tour in Iraq, Javier Rodriguez of Macon, Georgia died in a valiant attempt to protect the financial solvency of his new employer from the gluttony of an overweight customer when he inserted himself between the soft serve ice cream machine at a Country House Buffet restaurant and a four hundred pound woman Thursday afternoon.  According to official reports, Rodriguez, a non-US citizen who served eighteen months in Iraq before being discharged after sustaining the ill-effects of a concussive blast in January, died almost immediately from trauma he received from Jessica Clark of nearby Glenhaven when he attempted to repel the morbidly obese womans seventh trip back to the all-you-can-eat restaurants dessert bar.  Soon as he done it I said to myself, That boys got a screw loose standin between a fat lady and her sundae cart like that', described one eyewitness, But even though he looked real scared, he stood his ground and started begging her, saying Please lady no, and something about having a wife and kid to feed at home as the big fat cow started mooing, going, 'moooo', 'moooo', louder and louder until I realize shes saying move, but he wouldnt back down. I aint never seen nothin' braver.  After an estimated 30 second stand-off, Clark struck Rodriguez over the head with a clubbed fist, then stomped his prone body once before pouring a seventh large bowl of vanilla-chocolate swirl ice cream topped with hot fudge, brownie bits, M&Ms, peanuts and rainbow jimmies which she consumed inside of three minutes, well before the police arrived.  Commented Country House Buffet manager Chuck Patterson, For Javier it was not only about protecting the business he depended upon to provide for his family. It was something more. There was something about witnessing a very overweight person sweat while consuming fifteen fried fish filets, three pounds of lasagna and a gallon of clam chowder in one sitting that his sense of honor couldnt abide by.  Continued Patterson: But I blame myself. I shouldnt have told him what a predicament these people were putting our restaurant in. I should have known hed try something like this.  In view of Rodriguezs immigration status and the fact that he will not qualify for the attendant benefits a possible posthumous conferral of citizenship by the US government would bring if he had died in combat, friends and family are humbly requesting donations for a memorial service be sent to P.O.

" Immigrant Children Taking American Kids' Jobs http://newsmutiny.com/pages/Immigrant-Kids-Jobs.html Thousands of unaccompanied minors who have swarmed across the US border in recent months are beginning to take the jobs of America's boys and girls.  The undocumented children - originating mostly from the violence-stricken nations of Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador, were allowed temporary sanctuary for humanitarian reasons but have since leaked into communities across the US-Southwest, putting thousands of American kids out of work, their parents say.  A couple of Nicaraguans drove my seven year-old daughter's lemonade stand out of business, complained one mother from Escondido, Ca., She was so sad. She kept asking why we can't just ship those bastards back to where they came from.  In addition to the immigrants' deep impact on the lemonade industry, hundreds of junior landscapers, car washers, dog walkers and pet-sitters have been rendered unemployed.  Still, the immigrant children are not apologetic.  This is mercado libro - 'free market', remarked a 10 year-old Honduran boy named Juan, If I can making lemonade that taste better for less dinero, then this is capitalism.  The father of a boy who Juan put out of business did admit to enjoying a glass of his son's ouster's lemonade.  Said the man: Don't tell my wife, but it was very tasty. It was a nickel cheaper and he obviously used real fresh-squeezed lemons, not like my son who was using that powdered shit."	Satire
" Donald Trump Awards Medal of Honor to Himself http://newsmutiny.com/pages/Trump-Medal.html Donald Trump awarded his first Medal of Honor Monday, to himself.  In bestowing the honor for his conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity, the President detailed how he repeatedly confronted near-certain death in the course of saving 11 fellow soldiers during a battle along Vietnam's central coast in 1969.  Charlie had us surrounded, pinned down, Trump boisterously recalled the hellish day 48 years prior. The bombs were falling like rain, and the bullets were so thick, it was like a constant swarm of bees buzzing over our heads, he described. My general forbade me to risk myself to help my fallen buddies - it was too dangerous, he said - but I could see them out there in the bloody muck, all shot to pieces and blown up and whatnot, and I could hear them crying for help  and I knew I would go. I had to go.  Occasionally sliding off script to emphasize the extent of the awe he, And everyone else, shared for his brave actions, Trump recounted how he organized just half a platoon of Marines to repulse over 3,000 enemy troops during the harrowing fight.  Charlie had the high ground, but luckily we had me, and leading a squad of guys around their flank, I put my M-16 on full automatic and mowed down an entire company of VC - KA-KA-KA-KA-KA-KA-KA-KA! the President, swinging an invisible rifle over the audience, imitated the sound of automatic gunfire.  There were bodies everywhere. It was pretty wild, let me tell you, he said.  Meanwhile, James McLoughan, a veteran who rescued 10 of his fellow soldiers under nearly identical circumstances in a similar battle in Vietnam, stood stoically beside the Commander in Chief during the entirety of the two-hour long ceremony.  President Trump's actions sound very brave, McLoughan later remarked. Though I doubt he would say that he didn't do anything that lots of other guys would have done if put in the same position.  Later, Trump went on to compare his heroism in combat with his electoral victory last November.  Just like on the battlefields of Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, the Vietnamese had us outspent and outnumbered, and yet we prevailed, he said. Against all odds, we won the war in a landslide, and now they don't know what to do. They don't know what to do."	Satire

It can also lay mines and sneak around spying on people, he said. It's a real crime fighter. It can even go under water.  Commenting at the embarkation of its maiden voyage, Navy Secretary Ray Mabus emphasized that the Tennessee Williams would be no different than any of the other 77 submarines in the US fleet.  It will perform all the same functions as any of our other submarines. Just probably with a lot more singing, he said.  Crew member Ensign First Class C.J. Slater expressed his enthusiasm for being a part of the historical mission.  It's going to be a hoot, protecting America and all that. Look out bad guys, here comes freedom! he exclaimed.

" Sean Spicer Vehemently Denies Ever Being Press Secretary http://www.burrardstreetjournal.com/sean-spicer-vehemently-denies-ever-being-press-secretary/ ALEXANDRIA, VAMarried father-of-two and American citizen Sean Spicer has vehemently denied ever holding the position of White House Press Secretary in a hastily assembled press conference on his front lawn this evening. Mr. Spicer, who prohibited any video recordings of his short speech, told the gathered media outlets that reports that he served as White House Communications Director and Press Secretary from January to July 2017 were fake news. I am not now nor have I ever been the White House Press Secretary. Id advise anyone who wants to hear from the White House should continue to consult the Presidents Twitter timeline like the rest of us.  Mr. Spicer These allegations are totally false and constitute fake news. It is my understanding that the President, whom I have never met, will be tweeting something to that effect shortly, the recently unemployed Rhode Island native said, adding. Ill let the tweet speak for itself. In support of his claim the 45-year-old repeatedly misspoke, slurred his speech and mispronounced basic words including his own last name, giving those present the impression of someone wholly incapable of any form of public speaking. I dont even know what a Press Secretary is, he reiterated. Perhaps youre mistaking me for Melissa McCarthy. A lot of people do these days. Mr. Spicer then proceeded to take a few questions, calling on several reporters by name. He revealed that he was currently unemployed, having recently left his dream job due to excessive stress but had recently applied for a 3-month internship at The Onion and was taking Russian lessons in his spare time. When presented with indisputable photographic evidence of him serving as Press Secretary to President Trump, Mr. Spicer refused to answer and instead slowly faded into his garden bushes."	Satire

The proposed border wall, Trump claimed, will be much like the wall to be constructed on the U.S.-Mexico border. He promised the wall will keep out illegal Canadian immigrants, whose culture undermines American values. Theyre coming to the U.S. in droves, a proponent of the wall claimed at a rally. Theyre preaching radical ideas, like that the government ought to provide healthcare for its citizens. They also apologize too much. Here in America, were much more inconsiderate than that. Its madness! I really dont know what Trump is on about, a Canadian citizen interviewed stated. Nobody is trying to leave Canada for the U.S. If anything, we need a wall to keep Americans out. Trump also promised that the wall would be financed by the Canadian government. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau released a statement shortly after that this claim, of course, is false. Trump did not provide details regarding how he would convince his neighbor to pay for the proposed wall. At press time, it was unclear whether Trump intended to include the Alaska-Canada border in his plan."	Satire

Trump has declared that he is as surprised as anyone that he has not been impeached yet. Not being unfamiliar with firing people himself, Trump admits that considering the massive series of high-profile gaffes and blunders his administration have made in his short time in office, hes shocked to still be President. You know not much surprises me these days, but even I cant believe Im still here after everything Ive done, an exasperated Trump told NBC News. I just cant understand why the public arent calling for my head. You really have to question their judgement after a while. I mean I literally fired the head of the FBI because he was investigating my administrations ties to Russia. What more can I do? he asked, maintaining his actions would have definitely ended the presidency of literally anyone else. Americas 45th President claims that at this stage hes just seeing what he can get away with, having repeatedly leaked information to the Russians, goaded North Korea into nuclear war and made several threats towards Canada. Ive taken away our citizens healthcare, restricted womens rights to choose what to do with their body and branded the media a bigger threat than ISIS And not to mention all the lies, but yet here I stand, still in the Oval Office. Its crazy, he said, shaking his head. The American people have a lot to answer for. Maybe I actually will have to shoot someone on fifth avenue like I promised, but even then I highly doubt Id be fired, he mused, adding that only by making guns, pornography and fast-food illegal would he likely be impeached."

" Mike Pence Hospitalized After Becoming Trapped In Elevator With Woman http://www.burrardstreetjournal.com/mike-pence-elevator-disaster-with-unknown-female/ WASHINGTON, DCThe Vice President of the United States of America is said to be in a critical condition in the White House Medical Unit tonight after becoming trapped in an elevator with an unknown woman for almost 20 minutes. Doctors at the WHMU say Pence is lucky to be alive, claiming another minute in the 86 ft. death chamber would have surely ended the Indiana natives life. To be exposed to a young female in such a concentrated dose would be enough for any man, let alone one with such an extreme sensitivity to estrogen, Dr. Mann told the NY Post. Its best that he avoid contact with any woman for a few months, aside from his wife of course. A White House spokesman claimed the V.P. had become momentarily separated from his Secret Service detail, leading to him entering the elevator unescorted. It is believed that Vice President Pence was unaware a solitary female was already present at the time, and as we now know, tragically this woman was neither his wife, daughter or mother. The mysterious woman, currently being interrogated by Secret Service, was believed to have been fully grown, possibly reaching as tall as 5 feet 7 inches, meaning the Vice President stood little chance of suppressing his natural instinct to accept the womans undoubted lust for him. The fact that he was able to hold out for nearly 20 minutes without grabbing her is a testament to the kind of man, husband and feminist Mike is, President Trump later told reporters. God knows I would have cracked inside 60 seconds. According to CCTV the woman did attempt to dash out of the elevator once the VP entered, as is standard White House protocol for all female staff, but she was too late. The video shows the Vice President remained calm initially, casually ordering the woman to stand in one corner of the elevator and stare at her feet, with him doing the same in the opposite end. However, disaster struck once the elevator jerked to an abrupt stop and technicians informed the pair it could be up to 30 minutes before they would be freed. Pence immediately began gasping for air and desperately trying to loosen his tie as he slowly slid down onto the floor. I tried to help him, the young lady screamed as Secret Service dragged her away, but this only made the situation worse as video evidence shows the woman was not wearing a skirt that fully covered her knee, sending the VP into anaphylactic shock. Luckily emergency services were able to blast open the doors of the elevator in time to save the Vice Presidents life and in all likelihood save the young lady from the electric chair. Pence is expected to make a full recovery physically, however doctors warn the entire incident could result in some long-term psychological issues for the V.P. surrounding women."	Satire
" Trump Very Disappointed In Putin For Recommending Michael Flynn http://www.burrardstreetjournal.com/trump-blames-putin-for-flynn-appointment/ WASHINGTON, DCU.S. President Donald Trump has revealed he is very angry at Vladimir Putin for personally recommending the now former national security advisor Michael Flynn. The American President claims his Russian counterpart had totally vouched for Flynn, citing his trustworthiness and reliability as key assets, and Trump admitted he was incredibly disappointed in Putin. Flynns ties to Russia were publicly leaked in the media Monday, forcing Trumps hand after the President insisted he repeatedly warned Flynn to handle it. However the 45th President maintains he holds his friends in the Kremlin solely responsible:  Vlad swore to me that this was his guy, you know, this was THE guy, Trump dismayed, during his weekly conversation with Sean Hannity. But now, instead of hiding all my secret dealings with Russia, Flynns getting mixed up in all this shit himself. Its terrible. I mean how the hell are me and Vlad suppose to hide our top-secret relationship if we have these types of breaches. Its totally unacceptable. Trump professed he was shocked bigly when Flynn first revealed his conversations with Russia, saying he was hurt his advisor hadnt simply gone through him instead. At the end of the day, it shows a lack of trust in my ability as a leader, to conduct my shading dealings with Russia myself, he shrugged. What else could I do? However, always keen to learn and grow from an experience, Trump claims he will thoroughly vet whoever Russia selects as Flynns replacement. As for Flynn himself, having now been fired by two Presidents, the 59-year-old simply hopes itll be third time lucky when President Pence assumes office in a few weeks."	Satire

" Now That President Trump Has Finally Declared War On the LBQT Community, What Minorities Should He Target Next? http://christwire.org/2017/07/president-trump-officially-declares-war-on-lbqt-community-starts-military-ban/ Today President Trump finally unveiled his true heart toward the LGBT community by unleashing the SN2 mechanism, the classic backside attack, by banning members of the LGBT community from serving in the military.  While some conservative gays were absolutely shocked that Trump would do such things, it should have been patently obvious with his administration picks that President Trumps idea of Make America Great Again hearkens back to his childhood time of the late 1940s to 1950s, where the word gay meant happy, Jim Crow was the law of the South and women were all June Cleavers standing attention and ready to serve their Ward Cleavers.  The backlash against President Trumps decision to remove a sector of the LBGT community from the military service has been predictable.  George Takei is on Facebook making smarmy commentary, disgruntled Congressional members from liberal-voting districts are making enough noise so that their constituents will vote for them again and Republicans saw Trump follow-up his military announcement with a Tweet stating, WE WORSHIP GOD  in America.  Hook, line, sinker.  The art of the deal.  Liberals are sulking and fussing like angry children, conservatives are eating up Trumps demagoguery.  The official talking point is that President Trump  needed to save the GOP budget and key votes hinged on the drastic amount of money having to be spent on those Trump kicked out of service.  The truth of the matter is that the measure being debated was .00003% of the overall military budget, but cuts between 3  15,000 service members out of duty effective immediately.  Now that President Trump is rolling back rights, it is time to think if there are other minorities who are just burdening the military and beyond.  It is estimated that the army must spend more then $500,000,000,000 per year in programs aimed at diversity recruitment and training.   A dramatic increase of budget would be achieved if the army turned back to only housing Caucasian males.  Women could stay in America growing victory gardens while other minorities could just move back to their neighborhoods, as we know, segregation and separate and not equal schools, housing and roads would save America trillions.  If Trump were to push for such things, the only thing hed have to worry about are snarky retweets and Facebook social warriors ballyhooing him for a few days, but then just accepting the new reality and moving on.

The science is simple:  prayer is a more powerful and affordable health insurance for poor people than any commercial insurance plans in the market place.  It seems almost criminal that poor people would submit themselves to monthly premiums and copays that they cannot afford, when all they have to do is go find a good church and let the members freely administer prayer to them. Liberals will claim that there is no scientific documentation that prayers cannot heal people, but that is simply not true.  The science is pure and true, this is why the Trump Administration and Congress are rushing to get 22 million people off of that expensive Obamacare by passing the American Health Care Act.  And instead of calling the new insurance TrumpCare, it is more appropriate to call it True Cross because that will be the source of all healing the poors will be receiving once the wonderful new health insurance  prayer  is rolled out to them."

Scientists from the CDC found that their symptoms were consistent with homosexuality, though their families insisted that they previously showed no sort of interest in the lifestyle. Researchers found that the only thing all the men had in common is their smartphones contained the Snapchat app.  The Christian Defense League of Texas reports that as of Friday, over 6,586 have had their location snap mapped by gays on the prowl, some traveling as far as California or New York to the Bible Belt to get a taste of American beefcake.  Throughout the past decade, gays have been able to apply their mastery of computers to reconfigure many applications to secretly serve their agenda. To date, the most nefarious and well-known plot of the gay community took place when they were able to groom men on Christian Mingle into thinking they were building a relationship with a woman, when it was already too late with emotional involvement that they found they were attracted to a gay man playing catfish on the other end of the internet connection.  Researchers with CDL of Texas warn the Christian Mingle disaster is nowhere near the scope as the Snapchat tool, which could potentially leave millions of unsuspecting straight men prone and vulnerable to getting raunchy photos of toned backsides and seductive lips, getting all hot and heavy by the random images entering their phone, only to find out that it was images of a gay men hiding in the bushes or behind some shopping carts all along. Gays are randomly browsing Bitmojis to find avatars that look like good, wholesome Christian fathers who are in a heterosexual relationship. They are traveling as far as New York, California and even France once they find the right guy. They are then networking with each other, cornering these vulnerable straight men as they continue on their day, not knowing they are prey to a seductive predator who will shamelessly snapchat pictures of his glistening abs, perfectly chisled buttocks and lean, toned thighs to make a bored straight dad think hes being hit on by a hot co-ed, when in reality it is a group of gays closing in to get an inevitable taste of foreign DNA.  The Christian Defense League of Texas is warning straight men to turn off the location feature on their phones and to use the buddy system, checking in with a friend or colleague every hour or so in case they are the target of a gay sting.

" Donald Trump admits to killing puppies, rises 6 points in polls http://www.derfmagazine.com/news/politics/donald-trump-killing-puppies NEW YORK, NY - The latest controversy involving Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump has not hurt his status as the races frontrunner. Days after Trump admitted to randomly killing puppies, his lead in the polls grew by six points. Much like previous incidents that pundits believed would hurt Trump, the puppy killing affair has only bolstered his standing as an outsider and a non-traditional politician. Donald has my vote all the way, said fervent supporter Daniel Gunther of Florence, Missouri. Any of these other politicians, if they killed a puppy, theyd hide it. Theyd hire a PR firm and go on TV and cry about it like a big baby. Hell, Ill bet Hillary is killing some puppies right now as we speak. But we wont hear about it because of the liberal media and because she has a staff of hundreds of people who spend all day just covering up for her. The puppy killing, that was a hell of a move, said political analyst Paul Begala. Politicians have been scared away from the whole dog abuse thing since Lyndon Johnson held up that beagle by its ears. Donald Trump just let the whole world know that hes not afraid to go where others refuse, and many voters find that to be a refreshing change. Luckily for Donald, Charles Manson is not running for President. Charles penchant for not being afraid to speak his mind might resonate with the voters even stronger than Donalds. Though it resulted in a spike in his poll numbers, Donald Trump insists that the puppy killing was not a politically motivated stunt. Look, those puppies had it coming, said Trump. They were losers. Dont get me wrong, there are some good dogs out there, but these were losers. Just crawling around, chewing on toys, peeing and pooping. Not the types of puppies we need to make America great again. So, I fired them. By which I mean, I killed them. And I did a tremendous job. Other GOP candidates, perhaps fearing reprisal, have largely ignored Trumps puppy killing. New Jersey governor Chris Christie, however, did step into the fray. The killing of puppies by Donald Trump was a disgrace, ok? said Christie. What was the point? I urge my fellow Americans to put their trust in me as a great leader and as a superior puppy killer. I, for one, would have made sure that those puppies were eaten after they were killed. Even if I had to do it myself. Right there after I killed them. Theyre really not bad raw. For his part, candidate Jeb Bush attempted to cash in on the momentum Trump gained after the incident. I am one hundred percent against all of this political correctness we have today, said Bush while glumly poking a labrador retriever with stick. I have never been afraid of doing what I think is best, including poking this dog with a stick. However, the labrador quickly grew bored with Jebs poking and wandered off, along with the assembled crowd and media."	Satire
" Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump employ cupping for extra boost in campaigns http://www.derfmagazine.com/news/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-olypic-cupping WILMINGTON, NC - Following a campaign rally in Wilmington, North Carolina, Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump turned his back to the crowd and many noticed the large red circles on the back of his neck near his collar. At another rally in Tampa, Florida, supporters of Hillary Clinton noticed similar discolorations. After questions were raised with both campaigns, it has been revealed that both candidates are employing the cupping technique used by Olympic athletes in hopes of boosting their campaigns. The Clinton campaign has been secretive about exactly how much cupping is going on. Secretary Clinton is entitled to privacy in this matter, said spokesman Harold Blackmon. The exact locations and number of suctions have been accounted for, though several may have been deleted through no fault of Mrs. Clinton or her campaign, or her private cupping server. Any further questions can be addressed to Mrs. Clinton when she holds a news conference. Which, will be never. Hillary Clinton first became aware of cupping several years before the Rio Olympics. She actually learned about it from her husband, said former advisor Paul Begala. He came home one night with red blotches on various parts of his body and he explained to her the benefits of cupping. It turned out that the marks on Bill were actually hickies, but the explanation still took root. This cupping thing is turning out to be huge, said Republican nominee Donald Trump. Its even making America win again. In the Olympics. Notice, for the past four years, the USA has not won even one medal in the Olympics. Thanks Obama. But now we are winning again. Thanks to me. And suction cup attachments on the skin. Which are awesome and they look great on me. I am tempted to go shirtless horseback riding with Vladimir Putin to show everyone how great the red circles look on my beautiful orange skin. When asked how and where he gets the suction cups applied, Trump responded, Theres a very smart, coherent young man who hangs outside Trump tower. Smart kid. Well spoken kid. Good supporter. He has suction cups. He says hes gonna use them to climb my building, but for now hes happy to use them to cup my body."	Satire

We live in a time of marvels and wonder, said the British monarch. Where, in a nano-second, images of J-Laws ta-tas can be beamed across the world. Well, from this day forth, my unmentionables will only be seen by my beloved husband, my stable boy, my dozen Indian bath attendants, and that bitch the Queen of Sweden when I moon her while driving by in my horse drawn carriage. Im removing all selfies that include my queenly goodies from my celly, yo. Royal insiders had been concerned for a while now that the Queens penchant for taking the nude selfies would be discovered and that the images would be hacked. Shes quite disappointed that selfie-Saturday is no more, said a palace spokesman. But, indeed, the last thing she needs is some hacker lighting up Reddit with pictures of her trying on a new big bag of royal undies. Its such a shame though, shed only just figured out how to get a great angle while taking a selfie ass-shot. Though the nude selfies will be deleted from the royal iCloud, Queen Elizabeth has not decided the fate of other parts of her iCloud.

" Hillary Clinton used personal e-mail account to access State Department Candy Crush account http://www.derfmagazine.com/news/politics/hillary-clinton-email-candy-crush WASHINGTON, DC - An investigation into State Department emails has found problems with former Secretary of State Hillary Clintons improper use of personal email for government business. The investigation has further discovered that Clinton used her personal email to access and take over the State Departments Candy Crush gaming account. Every avenue is being explored, said investigator Walter Sokolowski. In these dangerous times, it is important for government officials to be held to a higher standard, especially when it comes to matters of national security. Its a domino effect. First comes  personal email being used for a government game app, then comes personal emails being used for launch codes, military secrets, and X-Box 360 accounts. We must stop the bleeding. Republicans and conservative media outlets have been fiercely critical of Clintons use of personal email to access the State Department Candy Crush account. This is a breach of the public trust, said House Speaker John Boehner. If Hillary Clinton is allowed to do this with the Candy Crush account, whats stopping Vladamir Putin from being allowed to use a personal email account to link into the governments Farmville 2 account, an account that has thrived into a spectacular farm, producing acres of fresh agriculture every hour. It is, in fact, the only evidence of bipartisan success achieved in Washington DC in the last fifteen years. Though the outrage is mounting, Hillary Clinton is downplaying the matter. I lost my old account and didnt want to start all over on level one, she explains. Id pushed through some really tough levels and I did it all for the American people. Besides, I made no secret of doing it. My login was HillaryClinton2016 and my password was BillisAJerk6969."	Satire
" Democrats demand to see birth certificate for Donald Trumps hair http://www.derfmagazine.com/news/politics/trump-hair-birth-certificate WASHINGTON, DC - As momentum grows for a possible White House run, increased scrutiny is being placed on Donald Trumps hair, and specifically its origin. Upping the rhetoric, Democrats have now called for Donald Trumps hair to produce a birth certificate for examination. Constitutional scholars are uncertain what impact the hairs birth certificate would have on a possible presidency. Our founding fathers were not clear on this subject, said historian Dennis Kerns. Many of them had hair of unknown origin, though usually of the powdered wig rather than double comb-over variety. A representative for Donald Trumps hair says that all questions will be answered in due time. This is nothing more than a smear campaign, said Donald Trumps hair spokesman Ronald Cole. Mr. Trumps hair will not dignify these rumors and false allegations as to its origin by commenting on them in any way. Mr. Cole was referring to allegations made by a hard core fringe group of Democrats who have come to be known as the Hairbirther movement. Members of the movement have made many claims as to the origin of Trumps hair, including that it is of foreign or extra-terrestrial origin. Others go further and allege that it is the product of a relationship involving bestiality. If Donald Trumps hair has nothing to hide, then we urge it to produce a birth certificate, said prominent Hairbirther Michelle Waxman. Without actually seeing the paper in front of me, with my own eyes, I am only left to conclude that Donald Trumps hair is indeed Belgian, marsupial, and at least slightly radioactive."	Satire

With the Trump administration in the middle of wildly celebrating three scandal free minutes of the presidency, reports began circling in the media that President Trumps son-in-law Jared Kushner was erroneously described on the White House website as qualified for the job. Weve no idea how a factual inaccuracy such as this made its way onto the website, but were seething, a White House spokesperson shared, as he crawled the site for any more misleading information. Kushner, who has been registered as female voter for 8 years, currently has responsibility for the partial re-greatification of America, taking out the bins, cleaning the toilets and achieving peace in the Middle East. Those in the Trump inner circle have ridiculed suggestions that a trivial story such as this will only help to distract people from the harmful actions Trump continues to take on foreign and domestic policy. Meanwhile the job of scanning through the rest of the White House website continues. Shit, were going to have to delete the whole fucking site, the spokesperson added when he landed on the page for President Trump. "	Satire

Military strategists and White House chiefs attended an emergency meeting late last night in preparation of the proposed plan, which theoretically increases the chances of another world war by 100%. The San Francisco-based company said that it was doubling the length of the classic 140-character tweet to 280, at least for a few select users chosen to be part of an experimental rollout, giving the United States a brief period in which it can prepare for a series of 280 character, late night tweets from Donald Trump. Preferably, we would have liked more time to prepare for this, said a Pentagon source, following the briefing, Mr. Trump has already contacted the Twitter CEO about trying the beta version, so were actively trying to delay that from happening, adding, these are sensitive times for our country. Mr. Trump, who is the first US President to run all state business through the micro-blogging site, is believed to be already practising his long form tweets, and said on the platform last night that he is looking forward to working extra hard with the new character limit extension. No one said this was going to be easy, Trump tweeted, referring to the increased workload now imposed on the US Presidents thumbs, believe me, this will be a great challenge and I may need to cancel a few trips, meetings with heads of state, health care, but I promise I will use the new Twitter character limit to the best of my ability. It is understood the new character limit is worth $456bn to the world economy."	Satire

Acting on a declaration of war by North Korea, in itself a response to what it claims was a direct declaration of war by the US, the White House has declared war on any and all declarations of war by North Korea, stressing that if a declaration or war is made in response to a declaration of war, then the United States will have no option left open to them other than to declare war. The declarations come after North Korean foreign minister Ri Yong-Ho declared that North Korea considered Trumps outburst over Pyongyangs continued nuclear testing to be an official declaration of war against the rogue state, and that North Korea would act to protect itself by shooting down US aircraft if it had to, angering officials in Washington who declared such statements to be, by themselves, a declaration of war. I think its pretty clear whos to blame here, said one political analyst, repeatedly blessing himself while trying frantically to call his wife and kids to tell them he loves them very much. Yep, this was all completely unavoidable. There was nothing anyone could have done at any stage to stop this escalation of aggression, and now we all just have to say a prayer that the death toll from the inevitable war is something that we can allow ourselves to live with.

Her first major act post-candidacy was to sign a 7-figure publishing deal to write a book for people who voted for her, this is exactly how you appeal to the alienated working class who staunchly refused to vote for her. Her finger remains firmly on the pulse of the American people, explained close Clinton confidant Joe Bastia. The political tome is a candid account of how Clinton is unable to be candid, preferring to give a calculated version of her experiences which best give the impression of a person humbled, emboldened and more determined than ever to put the American people second after her own ambitions. The memoir entitled What Happened is a detailed account of a small fraction of things that happened that Clinton and her team want the public to know, according to the books publisher. However, there are endless examples of instances in which Clinton was touched, moved and inspired by the type of ordinary people her team worked so hard not to expose her to. Come on, what do you think shes going to do, cop to being a rich white person and admit to being like 90% of other politicians. Ha, nice one, while shes being honest like that shell probably tell the public how much they fucked up her chance to be President, the stupid idiots. Dream on, explained publisher Jerry Klein.

The recent executive order calling for immigration bans from seven Middle Eastern and African countries has not only inspired outrage, but has also caused mass confusion. The details of the policy are muddy at best and it seems that even President Trump is confused on the rules and hopeful outcomes of the ban. I am very proud of my brain for coming up with this ban, President Trump began, Now instead of immigrating to the United States to achieve their dream of owning a home and a small business, our policy will force many Muslims from war-torn countries to get a job at ISIS just to earn enough money so that their children dont starve to death.

The primarily white, Christian crowd repeated after him that they too declared Allah to be the One True God who, through Trump, would bring back manufacturing jobs to the Iron Wall states. Trump concluded his speech with two raqaat of prayer, followed by a lengthy group duaa in which he prayed for a proper understanding of the Quran and enough votes in the Senate to confirm his Supreme Court nominee. He also repeated his promise to lock her up, referring to his intention to punish Hillary Clinton for carelessly using her email server without the supervision of any male guardians.

Oh, I dont let myself get wrapped up in that Twitter stuff, Mitchell says. Im just excited that we finally have a president who puts real Americans first.     While many have worried that Trumps tweets are a distraction from his controversial cabinet appointments, conflicts of interest, and unprecedented refusal of media access, Mitchell has proven the naysayers wrong by refusing to take the bait.     I didnt vote for Trump because of what he tweets, she explains. I voted for Trump because I want our jobs back from the Mexicans, I want the hundreds of ISIS members coming into our country every day to be stopped, and because I dont think having white skin is a crime.

Thats why I get my news from real sources: Breitbart, TheEagle.Macedonia, my nephews memes, and secret Facebook groups whose names I wont tell you because I dont want you to get the wrong idea about me and my friends.     Were good people, she adds.

" How Am I Supposed To Explain This To My Children? Asks Melania Trump http://reductress.com/post/how-am-i-supposed-to-explain-this-to-my-children-asks-melania-trump/ Its been a long and draining election cycle, and I dont think any of us could have expected the result that we saw today. For many of us with young children, you probably woke up this morning asking yourself, How am I supposed to explain this to my children?     I, Melania Trump, am asking myself the same thing.     How can any of us metabolize what happened to a ten-year-old? Should I be honest and let him know just how bad things are, or do I let him enjoy his childhood, his innocence a little while longer? How much longer can we pretend the bathroom door lock is broken while Donald is stuck in there?     Many of us are concerned about how our sons will learn to treat women in this dangerous, sexist climate. In the case of my son, the nations biggest tragedy since 9/11 just told him to stop being a pussy.     How am I supposed to explain that our next president is a bully, and also his father?         And how do I explain to my son that our next president is a man who intimidatingly looked over at my ballot, just to make sure I was still voting for him? Should I remind my son that this man is a terrible role model and his behavior unacceptable, just like Ive been quietly whispering to him for his entire short life?     And when he gets older, how am I supposed to tell them how this all began? That their father admitted to sexual assault, never shared his tax returns, was endorsed by the KKK, and still somehow weaseled his way into the presidency without even winning the popular vote? I used to believe that this country was an equal playing field where anyone can make it with hard work, but now Im not so sure. I hate that my son has to come of age in such a time of uncertainty and also have blood relation to the cause of it all.     What am I supposed to tell my only son about the loud, nasty man on TV who insults immigrants while hiring thousands of them, including me, his wife? Do I need to tell him anything at all when he is on the TV standing right next to that man?     It seems like its always on the tip of my tongue these days; that Donald Trump is a bad man. But I cant bring myself to tell him. Mostly because a man said hed send me back to Slovenia if I did. But in my heart, I am concerned for the future of our country. Im concerned for the world my son has to grow up in, and that his father is the next leader of the free world.     What have we done?"	Satire
" Hillary Clinton Allegedly Used Secret Email Addresses to Cast Spells on Enemies http://reductress.com/post/hillary-clinton-allegedly-used-secret-email-addresses-to-cast-spells-on-enemies/ As more details emerge surrounding Hillary Clintons second personal email address, many are questioning whether the private emails implicate Clinton in a cover-up of several magic spells cast upon her worst enemies. The revelation of the additional account has also raised questions about Clintons relationship with Sydney Blumenthal, a longtime advisor and purported wizard.     One exchange between Clinton and Blumenthal, revealed earlier this year, reads:     Fyi. The idea of using enchantment spells to arm the opposition should be considered.    Clinton refutes that claim, saying that the email was discussing strategies to help the opposition rebels oust Muammar Gaddafi in Libya and that it never read enchantment spells, but actually stated private security experts.     The email text you are referencing is a Photoshopped internet meme, contends Clinton.         The jurys still out amongst voters, however, with many Republicans raising questions as to whether the practice of magic may have conflicted with her duties as Secretary of State.     I dont need more than one email address, but then again, Im not a witch, says former Florida governor, Jeb Bush. I guess I would create a second or third email address if I was developing and casting a whole bunch of new top secret magical spells.     This accusation is insulting, Clinton said in a statement to the press. I am not a witch and never have been, because witches, as they are traditionally represented in popular fiction, do not exist. Would you ask a male presidential candidate if he was a witch?     You know what else sounds like a witchs spell? says Tucker Carlson on his program this Tuesday. Benghazi."	Satire
" New Bill Requires Women Seeking Abortions to Paint Still Life of Fetus http://reductress.com/post/new-bill-requires-women-seeking-abortions-to-paint-still-life-of-fetus/ In the latest attempt to discourage women from seeking abortions, Republicans have introduced a new bill requiring women to first paint a still life oil portrait of the fetus before consulting with a physician.     If the bill passes, abortion seekers will need to obtain pre-approval from a special committee made up entirely of men over 70 years old, each one selected for the quality of their masculine horse art rather than their knowledge of the female reproductive system.     We just want to make sure these women know exactly what theyre getting into, says one sponsor of the bill. And this is one painstaking and difficult way to do that.     The new bill requires all fetal portraits to be detailed and life-like, although it notes that some impressionism will be tolerated if it appears to express feelings of regret.     Though critics have noted current medical guidelines recommend pregnant women avoid exposure to oil-based paints, Rep. Pittenger (R  NC) claims, We would never compromise on artistic quality in the name of protecting women.     Women whose paintings fall short of these exacting aesthetic standards can re-submit a new painting after a one-month waiting period.     Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-ME) voted against the bill after failing to pass an amendment that would have added acrylics and watercolors to the list of approved media.    Rep. Pittenger states, I respect Molly, but when it comes to womens health we refuse to lower the bar. The rich colors of an oil painting can capture details of the fetus that you just cant see in a sonogram.     Under the new law, women would be responsible for purchasing all their own oil paints, easels, canvases, brushes, and gesso.         A Hobby Lobby spokesperson praised the bill as in-line with the companys values, while hospitals and clinics are expected to combat the law, claiming it will be expensive to provide women with adequate studio space.     Republicans in congress recommend any woman who believes she may someday need an abortion begin a two to four-year fine arts degree program immediately.     Pressed for a closing comment, Rep. Pittenger says, Ive heard of some women practicing their still-lifes with peaches, but the colors there arent quite right. So a background in the arts is absolutely vital, but we wont be paying for that either."	Satire
" Jaguars confident that Blake Bortles respect for the national anthem will get them into the playoffs http://sportspickle.com/news/jaguars-confident-blake-bortles-respect-national-anthem-will-get-playoffs.html Jaguars head coach Doug Marrone named Blake Bortles the teams starting quarterback today, putting a talented roster into the hands of a quarterback who has been one of the leagues worst over the past three seasons.  But instead of looking outside the team for a better quarterback, the Jaguars instead today doubled down on Bortles  and Marrone believes it will be enough to see Jacksonville win the AFC South and make the playoffs.  There are many who say that Bortles isnt a good quarterback and that he cant throw football near his receivers and that hes a proven loser, said Marrone. And not just many say that. All say it. Because its true. But one thing he does do is stand for the pregame national anthem  same as every quarterback who has won the Super Bowl. Sorry, but I think thats some pretty good company to be in. Ill take my chances.  Jaguars receiver Allen Robinson said he is happy that Jacksonville is sticking with Bortles.  Do I think well make the playoffs with him? No, not at all, said Robinson.

" Trump administration moves to ban all Indians: They are taking wins away from hard-working American Leaguers http://sportspickle.com/news/trump-administration-moves-ban-indians-taking-wins-away-hard-working-american-leaguers.html White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee-Sanders announced today that President Trump is set to release an executive order that will ban all Indians from the United States due to the great number of losses being suffered by American League teams.  This is an America first president, and that includes the American League, said Huckabee-Sanders. The president has made it clear he wants to ban Indians, from the baseball kind to the dot kind and the feather kind, until we get this figured out.  Huckabee-Sanders then added, when pressed by reporters that her dot-and-feather comment was racist, that anyone who accuses the president of racism is merely seeking to divide the country. The presidents spokesperson also refused to comment on reports that Trump ordered the Indian ban after overhearing part of a report on Fox News about the Cleveland Indians winning an American League record 21 games in a row.  If the implication is that the president was scrolling through Twitter while taking a bowel movement, and Fox was on in the other room and he just heard a brief snippet about Indians beating Americans and then yelled out to Stephen Miller, while still on the toilet, to ban all Indians from our country, said Huckabee-Sanders, well, thats all the time I have for questions today.  Cleveland Indians manager Terry Francona said his team plans to continue to keep playing as long a they can.  Our motivation this whole streak is that the world is basically fked, so we may as well play our best until the whole thing goes to hell, said Francona. This executive order does nothing to change that point of view."	Satire

President Trump has really enjoyed talking about the NFL and NASCAR in recent days, said White House spokesman Sarah Huckabee Sanders. He feels the best way to get out his sports takes is to go full-time into sports talk radio. The nuclear faceoff with North Korea, our wars in the Middle East and Puerto Rico being underwater were threatening to derail his opinions on standing for the national anthem at football games, and so he is stepping away from the presidency effective immediately.  Trumps presidency ends eight months and five days after his inauguration, or approximately seven months longer than many expected.  I feel I was able to accomplish much for the American people in my time as president, read a statement from Trump following his resignation. I helped America understand that the NFL is bad and that I dont like Stephen Curry. Also, Im told I made a Supreme Court judge. I hope the judge is not Steph Curry and is maybe one of the Pittsburgh Penguins. Please tune into Sports Radio 980: The Yakker tomorrow for more.  Trump will be joined on his radio show by new co-host Jay Mariotti, while Mike Pence will takeover as President of the United States.  While I want all the players to stand for the anthem, they have a right not to, said Pence. However, I do think they should be fired if they kneel down in a gay way.  Sports Radio 980s station manager Mike Thomas says he is excited to have the former president aboard.  We like strong takes and divisive takes that get people talking, said Thomas. Theres no one better than Donald at doing that. I expect huge ratings for a long time, with the added bonus of us probably not all dying in a nuclear war started via tweet now."	Satire

The move comes in the wake of the Charleston, SC, church shooting that led to nationwide protests against, and bans of, the Confederate flag, as well as vandalization of many Confederate war memorials. This week, North Carolina Democrats, under pressure from the NAACP, dropped the presidential names from their annual Jefferson-Jackson dinner, to erase the legacy of slavery and genocide.  The nickel, quarter, dollar bill and two-dollar bill will no longer circulate among Democrats because George Washington and Thomas Jefferson owned slaves, said DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz. The DNC has also decided to purge the $20 bill because of what Andrew Jackson did to Native Americans. The $10 note, likewise, is forbidden for party members, because Alexander Hamilton signed the Constitution, which perpetuated slavery.  Wassermann Schultz called on all Democrats to pay for goods and services using only the FDR dime, or the dollar coins bearing the images of Susan B. Anthony or Sacagawea.  Fifties, fives and pennies are still under a longstanding DNC ban because Ulysses S. Grant and Abe Lincoln were both Republicans.  However, the Democrats grant specific exemptions for use of the $100 bill by rap stars and Hollywood entertainment industry figures, because the Benjamins have become essential to those culturally-valuable lifestyles.  For all other Democrats, the C-Note is verboten because Ben Franklin was a shameless capitalist whose rags-to-riches story gives a false impression to children about the power of free markets, and the value of hard work, she said."

Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican, ended speculation about his future today with a speech at Liberty University in which he announced that hes officially Wrong for you. Wrong for America, thus becoming the first candidate to launch a 2016 presidential bid.  To swelling cheers and applause of Liberty students, Cruz said hes too Conservative to win a general election, has no executive experience, is the hand-maiden of Big Oil, a backer of vulture capitalists, and wants to force all citizens to bow to Jesus.  He also launched a whisper campaign on Twitter (@TedCruzWrong) that suggested he might not even be Constitutionally-eligible to serve because his father came from Cuba, and that he loves the Constitution because it keeps women in their place.  At the climax of the address, Cruz shouted over the crescendo of applause: People I briefly met years ago will soon make it clear that Im not the man I appear to be.  The candidate, who claims hell repeal every word of Obamacare and Common Core, said a search is currently underway to find video or audio of him contradicting those statements. He received a standing ovation when he claimed he will stand with the nation of Israel, because Im a tool of the global Jewish conspiracy.

I know ISIS loots, pillages and burns. But 2 out of 3 aint bad. Thnk abt it. Instead of burning caged hostages, consider renewables.

Speaker Boehner has certainly been surrounded by other peoples money, coming and going, but its not the same, an unnamed Congressional aide said.

Boehner reportedly made the decision to resign after listening to Pope Francis speaking to a joint session of Congress about the moral hazards of capitalism. The Congressman identified with the poor and oppressed who feel locked out of the lucrative opportunities enjoyed by the wealthy few just on the other side of that revolving door.  The Pope  with his gold city, global travel and obsequious servants  reminded Speaker Boehner how important it is to care for the least among us, the source said, and standing next to the Supreme Pontiff, he couldnt help but feel like one of them, and believe that there must be more to this life than just spending other peoples money."

I am proposing a one child law for Hispanics immediately at the beginning of my term  lets make America great again!  If Trump gets his way, the law that he is proposing would go into effect for Hispanics on visas, Hispanics applying for citizenship, and undocumented Hispanics. Hispanic families who received citizenship prior to 2016 would not be affected by this new law. If a pregnancy results in the birth of twins, then two children will be permitted. The government will provide free medical services for tubal ligations and vasectomies immediately following the birth of their first child, if Donald Trumps law goes into effect. Any Hispanic family wishing to relocate to the United States with more than one child, will have to leave the other children in their home country  forcing families to choose their favorite child to bring with them.

" Did Fox Anchor Banderas Use Fake News To Help Trump Smear Desperate Puerto Ricans? http://www.newshounds.us/fox_anchor_banderas_fake_news_help_trump_smear_desperate_puerto_ricans_100117 Banderas apparently rattled after Trump was filleted by her liberal guest Liberal Fox News contributor Jessica Tarlov did a terrific job of ripping Trump over his attacks on Cruz yesterday. Tarlov noted that Trump has a habit of attacking a sitting official during a time of crisis before adding that it shows how unfit he is for this office.  They are American citizens, three million of them, Tarlov said about Puerto Ricans. I know they dont have Electoral College votes - and I dont want to say that that is exactly why this is happening but you didnt hear him talking to people in Texas or Florida this way.  The conservative guest, Beverly Hallberg, mostly defended the federal relief effort, not Trump. Nor did she suggest he was right to attack Mayor Cruz.  So Banderas jumped in to do the job herself.  Banderas tried to validate Trump by blaming Puerto Rican truckers and Mayor Cruz for relief problems BANDERAS: How do you truly believe the mayor of San Juan is handling this when shes on television, cable, network broadcast news every single day? Heres video of last nights press conference. And look behind her. What do you see? You see aid and food. Why isnt it being delivered? Thats another question. Because the truckers, the Puerto Rican employees are on strike. They dont want to move those food and supplies. Or they are unable or they are refusing. Some are expecting $50 an hour to do so.  Now, when the president accuses Puerto Ricans of not necessarily trying to help themselves, what are the optics behind that press conference with all that aid behind the mayor of San Juan?  Where did Banderas get her claim about a truckers strike in Puerto Rico? The accusation that Puerto Rican employees are refusing to deliver aid because they are on strike was news to me. So I tried to find out what she was talking about. And guess what? I couldnt find confirmation anywhere. That includes todays Fox News Sunday interview with FEMA director Brock Long in which he specifically discussed problems distributing commodities.  I did find an article in the widely-read, pro-Trump blog, Conservative Treehouse making this accusation. It relied first and foremost on this HuffPost quote by Puerto Rican Colonel Michael A. Valle (Torch), Commander, 101st Air and Space Operations Group, and Director of the Joint Air Component Coordination Element, 1st Air Force, responsible for Hurricane Maria relief efforts:  They have the generators, water, food, medicine, and fuel on the ground, yet the supplies are not moving across the island as quickly as theyre needed.  Its a lack of drivers for the transport trucks, the 18 wheelers. Supplies we have. Trucks we have. There are ships full of supplies, backed up in the ports, waiting to have a vehicle to unload into. However, only 20% of the truck drivers show up to work. These are private citizens in Puerto Rico, paid by companies that are contracted by the government.. (link)  Yet in the next paragraph, which was not included in the conservative article, Valle completely absolved the drivers.  Put another way, 80% of truck drivers do not show up to work, and yet again, its important to understand why.   There should be zero blame on the drivers. They cant get to work, the infrastructure is destroyed, they cant get fuel themselves, and they cant call us for help because theres no communication. The will of the people of Puerto Rico is off the charts. The truck drivers have families to take care of, many of them have no food or water. They have to take care of their familys needs before they go off to work, and once they do go, they cant call home, explains Col. Valle.  Also included in the Conservative Treehouse article was a CNBC video of reporter Contessa Brewer that confirmed Valles remarks:   BREWER: The truckdrivers cant get to the terminal to get these containers out.  Youre looking at truck drivers who cant be reached by their businesses, by cellphone, they dont have the gas to get to work and even when they do get to work, their semi trucks dont have fuel.  There was also an amateur Spanish-language YouTube video of the head of the Puerto Rico truckers union supposedly suggesting it was payback time for the governor (apparently there is a pre-existing dispute between them). My Spanish is not good enough to translate but one of the commenters on YouTube said that despite the criticism, the union head had urged his workers to mobilize.  Meanwhile, CNN reported yesterday, but Banderas did not mention, that the Teamsters and the AFL-CIO are working together to recruit truckers to go to Puerto Rico to help with the distribution.  Banderas attacked Cruz for politicizing tragedy while defending Trumps attacks on her as just the way he handles things Banderas also attacked Cruz for complaining that FEMA required her to contact them online when there is no internet available.  BANDERAS: Its just sad to see politicians exploit the lives of people who are in great risk and that includes the mayor of San Juan If I were a resident of Puerto Rico, I wouldnt want to hear my mayor speaking about us this way. I mean, President Trump lifted the Jones Act essentially to prohibit these foreign ships from being blocked from being able to deliver aid so that has been done. I havent heard one word of acknowledgment from this mayor who is also calling out the administration because FEMA says that you need to contact them via the internet. Well, they dont have the internet. Well, yes, there are glitches in the system but you cant blame it all on one man, the president, because the system was in place long before the president took office.  Tarlov did not relent. She agreed that the problems are bigger than Trump but, she added, I think that we can all agree that the president of the United States of America does not need to spend his weekend at his private golf course tweeting in a disparaging way about an official ... concerned that her citizens are going to die.  Predictably, Banderas would not concede even that point. Because it's Trump!  BANDERAS: Yeah, it is the presidents style. If somebody goes after him, hes gonna punch back. Thats just the way he handles things. Im not saying that its the best way, the best scenario, but again, if Im the mayor of a town whose people are dying, Id worry less about tweets and news conferences.

" Abby Huntsman: Trumps Big Water Excuse For Puerto Rico Relief Problems Makes Total Sense http://www.newshounds.us/abby_huntsman_trump_s_moronic_big_water_excuse_puerto_rico_relief_total_sense_093017 As Puerto Ricans suffer and die in the wake of Hurricane Maria, Fox & Friends might have you think that Donald Trump is the real victim because hes not getting the credit he deserves from the left-wing media for what hes done for the island. Ironically, this was shortly before Trump went on a Twitter rampage attacking Puerto Ricans.  Guest Dan Bongino started the conservative victimhood: You know the media and you wonder why Americans want to vomit every time they have to listen to the left-wing media coverage. He also complained that the medias love for President Barack Obamas far from perfect response to Superstorm Sandy, along with a hug from Governor Chris Christie (R-NJ), may have gotten Obama re-elected.  Then Bongino got back to Trump and the media: And now you have Donald Trumps response to Puerto Rico, to this devastating storm. No question a massive tragedy and what are they doing? Instead of trying to help theyre actually fabricating this story.  Bongino cited the governor of Puerto Rico who said all his calls had been answered by Trump and that the federal government is doing everything they can.  Nevertheless, Trump's public behavior toward the Puerto Rico crisis was apathetic before he went on a Twitter rant against San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz later this morning. Trumps ridiculous, earlier defense against criticism didnt help either: The response and recovery effort probably has never been seen for something like this. This is an island surrounded by water. Big water. Ocean water.  Bongino argued that Trump actually has to say things that are obvious to make sure that the media gets the story, like, Hey folks, Puerto Rico is an island. Its surrounded by water. Like big water. That's the president having to explain to the media, right? What an island is because they dont seem to get that the logistics are different.  As MSNBCs Steve Benen noted, Puerto Rico is no more remote from Miami than Trumps Florida golf resort is to the White House. Its obviously an island, but its not in the middle of a very big ocean, Benen pointed out.  Instead of correcting the record, cohost Abby Huntsman put forth more pro-Trump propaganda, including a falsehood:  HUNTSMAN: It all makes sense. I mean the way he worded it, it makes total sense.  ...Ive noticed whenever there is something positive to talk about when the president is on the ground, like we saw him in Houston. We saw him in Florida there hugging people, embracing them, making them feel comforted, like the government is going to be there for whatever they need. You dont see those positive stories ever in the mainstream media.  So where is that balance? I understand that the medias role, youve gotta be critical at times but you never see the other side, you never see the good times.  Did Huntsman bother to check before making this declaration? If so, she somehow either missed these news reports or she was lying.  Ditto for Bongino. The difference is the medias role to be critical is only to be critical of Republicans, he claimed.  45 minutes later, Trump went on his Twitter rampage that undoubtedly did nothing to comfort any Puerto Ricans. But Huntsman and her Fox Friends will surely find a way to spin that in Dear Leaders favor, too."	Satire
" Breaking News: HHS Secretary Tom Price Resigns. Fox Already Suggesting Obama To Blame For Scandal http://www.newshounds.us/breaking_news_hhs_secretary_tom_price_resigns_fox_pointing_obama_092917 HHS Secretary Tom Price has resigned in the wake of revelations that he took hundreds of thousands of dollars of private plane trips at taxpayer expense. Fox News is already suggesting it might be Obama's fault.  Yesterday, Price appeared on Fox News' Special Report with Bret Baier. I wrote, [T]he fact that anchor Bret Baier did nothing to help Prices rehab suggested he's still in Republican disrepute.  A few minutes ago, it was announced that he had resigned. The Washington Post reported:  Politico, which first reported on Prices repeated use of chartered jets, has estimated the total expense of the taxpayer-funded trips exceeded $400,000  and it reported early Thursday evening that his White House-approved flights on military planes to Africa, Europe and Asia cost more than $500,000.  Besides the charter flight issue, Trump has also directed some of his frustration at Price over the inability of Republicans in Congress to pass a health-care-reform bill.  Fox News is already at work trying to make sure nobody blames Donald Trump for the swampy, White House-approved behavior of his own cabinet member. The FoxNews.com article about Price's resignation includes these gratuitous swipes at Obama:  OBAMA OFFICIALS ALSO TOOK PRICEY, NON-COMMERCIAL PLANES  Speaking to reporters on Friday, the president referenced how officials with the Obama administration also used government planes.  If you look at the Obama administration, and you take a look at the amount of time that they spent in the air, they spent a lot of time in the air, Trump said.  According to statistics provided by a senior administration official, the Trump White House has authorized fewer trips on military planes for senior officials than the Obama administration did during the first eight months in office.  From Jan. 20 to Sept. 19, the Trump administration authorized 77 military flights, while the Obama administration allowed 94 flights during the same time period, according to the stats.  There is no explanation in the article about how or why the White House approved Price's travel.

Naturally, hes an evangelical adviser to Donald Trump.   Earlier this week, Jeffress visited Fox & Friends to defend, I mean discuss, Trumps criticism of black NFL players taking a knee during the national anthem.  Instead of trying to understand the players' actions, Jeffress scolded them for not appreciating that they dont live in North Korea:  ROBERT JEFFRESS: I think what these players are doing is absolutely wrong. These players ought to be thanking God that they live in a country where theyre not only free to earn millions of dollars every year, but theyre also free from the worry of being shot in the head for taking a knee like they would be with the were in North Korea. And I think tens of millions of Americans agree with President Trump when he says they ought to be called out for this. I know this president. President Trump is not a racist.

" Trumps NFL Subtext: Im The Only White Guy Patriotic Enough To Take On The Blacks! http://www.newshounds.us/trump_s_nfl_subtext_i_m_only_white_guy_patriotic_enough_blacks_092817Donald Trumps hideous new dog whistle on Fox & Friends, in which he lectured the mostly white NFL owners over being afraid of their black players who #TakeAKnee during the national anthem, had an equally hideous subtext: that owners should take a cue from his mastery of the subject.  Trump knew that Fox & Friends cohost Pete Hegseth would never challenge a word during their interview that aired today. As The Washington Posts Philip Bump noted, a Trump interview on Fox & Friends is a little like a corporate chief executive being interviewed by his own P.R. department. Not only because the P.R. department isnt going to ask hard questions, mind you, but also because the chief executive is often happy to talk up how great his team is.  Hegseth has also shown an affinity for Trumps racial dog whistles. He called Trumps refusal to denounce Charlottesville white supremacists a unifying message.  Hegseth covered some substantive topics in the interview such as tax cuts and health care. But they were covered, as Bump put it, with [l]eading questions, little follow-up and all the space in the world to say whatever [Trump] wanted to say. Do check out his column exploring the kinds of follow-up questions that any interviewer not in the tank for Trump would have asked.  Media Matters Pam Vogel pointed out that Hegseth seemed to have sourced his questions from the presidents own unhinged Twitter accountonce again. She also noticed, The two men did not find time to discuss the humanitarian crisis 3.4 million American citizens are currently facing in Puerto Rico (or, if they did, Fox didnt think it was worth airing).  Yet, during the extended time Fox gave Trump to play overseer of the NFL plantation, there was no discussion about the reason the players are protesting, racial injustice. It was yet another way to delegitimize them.  In his opening question to Trump about the NFL, Hegseth helped validate Trumps attack.  HEGSETH: Your critics say its been a distraction, but you say its critical. And you talk about words like patriotism and citizenship.  Why is this such an important issue for you?  Trump replied by boasting that its not a distraction at all because hes doing a lot and with awesome success (in his mind).  Then he started dictating to the NFL. Thats disturbing enough, given that its a private business. But underneath that attack was the not-so-subtle suggestion that being willing to attack the (black) players makes Trump braver and more patriotic than the white owners who dont:  TRUMP: I saw this a year ago with [Colin] Kaepernick. And I said this is a terrible thing. I thought it was terrible. And then it builds up a little bit and a little bit more and you see whats been happening. And then all of a sudden, you see more and more and more.  And I came out and made a statement in Alabama the other day and I said, I think its very disrespectful to our country. And the worlds picked it up.  And guess what?  Most people agree with me. And the NFL is in a box. They have to do something about it. Theyre disrespectingand when I say they, in a way, it is they, because they can stop it.  []  I have so many friends that are owners. And theyre in a box. I mean Ive spoken to a couple of them. They say, we are in a situation where we have to do something.  I think theyre afraid of their players, you want to know the truth. And I think its disgraceful. And theyve got to be tough and theyve got to be smart, because you look at the ratings. The ratings are going way down. The stadiums areIve seen a couple of stadiums over the last few weeks. They are losingthere are a lot of empty seats. I couldnt even believe it.  Back in the studio, Huntsman gushed over this message, saying we need to hear more of Trumps important conversations with NFL owners:  HUNTSMAN: I love these interviews with President Trump because hes off script and he gives us a sense of conversations that he has behind closed doors, where its like, Look, Ive talked to some of these owners. They tell me that they are in a really tough position. And he said at one point that they are afraid, he thinks, of the players. Thats a comment that you would not hear from a president ever but he lets us know the real conversations that are had, the important conversations that we probably need to hear about."	Satire
" Home Depot Founder Vies to Become Official Sponsor of Mexico-America Wall, Endorses Trump http://www.empiresports.co/home-depot-founder-vies-to-become-official-sponsor-of-mexico-america-wall-endorses-trump/ Is there some rule out there we dont know about that states that founders of major DIY retail chains have to get involved in politics eventually? We saw that the people behind Hobby Lobby were all too eager to jump out of their lane (craft supplies) when the moment arose, and now and it is becoming clear that they learned by watching the founder of Home Depot, who just cant stay out of the political arena (made in part, presumably, withPremium Birrill Fir Studs).  Bernie Marcus wrote a piece for Real Clear Politics to announce that he is supporting Donald Trump. Granted, he is a home improvement store founder, so no one really asked him, but he did it, we have it, and we are moving forward with the new information now. If someone were to ask me, Id say hes just doing the same thing people speculated Ben Carson and Chris Christie might have been doingwhen they came out in favor of Trump. In the same way there were rumors that Carson and Christie were simply gunning for a chance at being vice president or getting into Trumps cabinet, I think Marcus just wants to make sure that if Trump gets the presidency, Home Depot becomes the Official Sponsor of the Mexico-America Wall.  Anyway, asking yourself what Marcus reasoning is? Here are a few snippets.  A plug for the American Dream/Home Depot came first:  But I draw even more from lessons learned when we founded The Home Depot in 1978 rather than from the contentious GOP primary of 2016. I genuinely believe that if we to started The Home Depot today, we would fail because of the hurdles government, especially the current administration, places in front of small business owners.  I never forget The Home Depots small business roots  we started as a small business with four stores in Atlanta, Georgia.  Next came a just-because sort of attack on media and academia:  Politicians like Obama and Clinton, aided by the media and academia, have peddled a dangerous sentiment that government can provide for Americans better than the private sector.  That shade on media and academia came amidst glorification of the job creation inherent in the founding of small businesses. Note that Marcus took time to praise his employees who have been able to get wealthy without college degrees, but in one quick statement, took a swipe at everyone who works at a university, lab, library, newspaper, television station, etc. So, are jobs really the main focus here at all?  He concluded by targeting the #NeverTrump Republicans:  As a GOP donor who stood steadfastly behind Jeb Bush and who has contributed to candidates for a generation  I urge all Republicans to stand up and be counted in support for Donald Trump.  In time, we will surely learn the political inclinations of every founder, mogul, and, in Marcus words, young [man willing] to shag carts from a parking lot because he has faith that he and his family can be great. Marcus is just one of the first of many this election season.  In conclusion, make repainting your living room for the ninth time because youre so bored and lonely that it physically hurts and maybe a sea-foam green accent wall will fill the void your ex-girlfriend left great again or something."

" Assange Truth Bomb: Hillary Clinton And ISIS Are Funded By The Same Money http://cityworldnews.com/assange-truth-bomb-hillary-clinton-and-isis-are-funded-by-the-same-money/ In the second excerpt from the John Pilger Special, to be exclusively broadcast by RT on Saturday, courtesy of Dartmouth Films, Julian Assange accuses Hillary Clinton of misleading Americans about the true scope of Islamic States support from Washingtons Middle East allies.  In a 2014 email made public by Assanges WikiLeaks last month, Hillary Clinton, who had served as secretary of state until the year before, urges John Podesta, then an advisor to Barack Obama, to bring pressure on Qatar and Saudi Arabia,which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL [Islamic State, IS, ISIS] and other radical Sunni groups.  I think this is the most significant email in the whole collection, Assange, whose whistleblowing site released three tranches of Clinton-related emails over the past year, told Pilger in an exclusive interview, courtesy of Dartmouth Films.  All serious analysts know, and even the US government has agreed, that some Saudi figures have been supporting ISIS and funding ISIS, but the dodge has always been that it is some rogue princes using their oil money to do whatever they like, but actually the government disapproves. But that email says that it is the government of Saudi Arabia, and the government of Qatar that have been funding ISIS.  Assange and Pilger, who sat down for their 25-minute interview at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where the whistleblower has been a refugee since 2012, then talk about the conflict of interest between Clintons official post, which held throughout Obamas first term, her husbands nonprofit, and the Middle East officials, whose stated desire to fight terrorism may not have been sincere.  John Pilger: The Saudis, the Qataris, the Moroccans, the Bahrainis, particularly the first two, are giving all this money to the Clinton Foundation, while Hillary Clinton is secretary of state, and the State Department is approving massive arms sales, particularly Saudi Arabia.  Julian Assange: Under Hillary Clinton  and the Clinton emails reveal a significant discussion of it  the biggest-ever arms deal in the world was made with Saudi Arabia: more than $80 billion. During her tenure, the total arms exports from the US doubled in dollar value.  JP: Of course, the consequence of that is that this notorious jihadist group, called ISIL or ISIS, is created largely with money from people who are giving money to the Clinton Foundation?  JA: Yes.  Pilger also questioned Assange over increasingly frequent accusations from the Clinton camp, and Western media, that WikiLeaks is looking to swing next weeks US presidential election in favor of Donald Trump  perhaps at Russias behest.  But Assange dismissed the prospect of Trump, who is behind in the polls, winning as unlikely  and not necessarily due to his standing with the electorate.  My analysis is that Trump would not be permitted to win. Why do I say that? Because he has had every establishment off his side. Trump does not have one establishment, maybe with the exception of the Evangelicals, if you can call them an establishment, said Assange. Banks, intelligence, arms companies, foreign money, etc. are all united behind Hillary Clinton. And the media as well. Media owners, and the journalists themselves. "	Satire

In an interview with The Red Shtick, Trump regaled us with his other thoughts on the war that an angry Jackson totally saw coming. Trump has been struggling to defend his comments  widely deemed preposterous, even by St. Landry Parish educational standards  in which he claimed a man who owned as many as 300 slaves wouldve found a way to prevent the Civil War.

I could have sworn I put my trailblazing approaches to ushering in a new era of prosperity in here somewhere, said Kushner as he pulled out random sheets of paper and quickly scanned them in hopes some might contain his strategy for bringing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to a swift, peaceful conclusion or his innovative approach to battling the nations opioid epidemic. Come on, come on. I just saw my visionary infrastructure plan that would create jobs for millions of Americans like a week agomaybe its in the car? Couldnt hurt to look there at this point. At press time, Kushner was still unable to locate his notes for dissuading his father-in-law from taking such a soft stance toward neo-Nazism but ultimately decided he wasnt too excited about that project anyway."

" Trump Administration Announces New $20 Bill Design Honoring Harriet Tubmans Owners http://www.theonion.com/article/trump-administration-announces-new-20-bill-design--56829 WASHINGTONSaying they wished to pay tribute to the legacies of these distinguished, law-abiding Americans, the Trump administration announced Friday that a long anticipated redesign of the $20 bill would honor Harriet Tubmans owners. These were patriotic business proprietors who followed the laws of their time to further their economic interests, and this new currency design finally recognizes these enterprising individuals for their success, said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at an afternoon press conference, explaining that the bills commemorating those responsible for enslaving the famed abolitionist, Civil War nurse, and womens rights activist for the first three decades of her life would be in circulation by 2018. For too long, weve overlooked the achievements of these upstanding citizens and prosperous agriculturalists. The new $20 note, which will feature a portrait of the Brodess family on the front and a depiction of the Maryland plantation they operated on the back, will at last give them their proper place in American history. Mnuchin then sought to assuage any concerns about the decision, assuring those in attendance that the Trump White House was already looking into ways to preserve Andrew Jacksons likeness by having it replace Abraham Lincoln on the $5 bill.

The report also revealed that the country continues to be regarded as a paragon of excellence and a refuge for all humanity despite its commander-in-chief risking the loss of billions of dollars in potential revenue and the termination of vital public services because he really, really wants the big concrete wall and wants it now. Researchers confirmed that this nation, which may grind to a halt due to the leaders demand for a big, giant, cement wall, is absolutely convinced that every other nation should be just like it."

" Clinton Already Working On Follow-Up Book Casting Blame For Failures Of First http://www.theonion.com/article/clinton-already-working-follow-book-casting-blame--56870 CHAPPAQUA, NYSaying it would provide a candid account of her experiences writing an unsuccessful tell-all, sources confirmed Thursday that Hillary Clinton is already working on a follow-up book casting blame for the failures of her previous memoir What Happened. From my agent negotiating that underwhelming deal with Simon & Schuster, to the graphic designers lackluster cover art, to my so-called supporters who couldnt be bothered to drop $17.99 for the hardcover copyeveryone had a hand in undermining my last books success, reads a passage from the introduction to Clintons What Also Happened, which repeatedly decries her prior books indecipherable font and dedicates an entire chapter to lashing out at her copy editor for making her look like an idiot third-grader. Ill never forget how Amazon buried me and how Barnes & Noble completely sabotaged me by displaying my book way in the back in that no mans land by the CDs. Frankly, its obvious I got screwed on all sides. Accusing them of stealing her spotlight, the book reportedly concludes with a long list of every other celebrity who published a memoir in the past year."	Satire
" TACO BAN: PRESIDENT TRUMP PUSHING FOR THE BAN OF MEXICAN FOOD IN THE U.S. https://www.huzlers.com/taco-ban-president-trump-pushing-for-the-ban-of-mexican-food-in-the-u-s/ WASHINGTON DC  Months after Trumps Muslim ban, prohibiting the travel from a list of middle eastern and African countries that pose a threat to the U.S, It is being reported that Trump is also pushing towards a Taco ban. Trumps hatred for illegal immigrants is no secret, specifically Mexicans. Promising to soon have a wall built on the US/Mexico border to keep illegals out. But nobody ever thought Trumps hatred for Mexicans to ever reach these heights. However, a Taco ban wouldnt be an accurate term for the proposed ban, as Trump is pushing to have most mexican dishes and products to be banned from America, which includes: tacos, tortas, tostadas, quesadillas, horchata, etc. However, according to Trumps team, tequila is still being intensely debated. Although later admitting that he is somewhat a fan of the elote man, Trump told the press: We have to get rid of all the Mexican food. If we want to make America great again, we have to earn the respect we once had. Mexico takes us as a joke because they know we[Americans] love Mexican food, and think we cant live without Mexican culture, but its my job as the president to show them we can, we have to make America great again. We want nothing to do with Mexico. If all the Mexican food is gone, Mexicans will start leaving as well.  Although many Trump supporters are most likely slowly becoming aware that their president is indeed suffering from some sort of yet to be diagnosed mental disorder, experts believe they will still continue to agree and follow with any of his actions. After recently failing to repeal and replace Obamacare, experts believe Trump felt he had to ban something to feel he was in control again, thus leading to the Taco Ban proposal.  According to Trump, he will issue an executive order for the Taco ban in April, as he also did with the Muslim Ban. Stay tuned for updates on the taco ban and President Trump."	Satire
